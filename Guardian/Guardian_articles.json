The investigation uncovered sexual abuses by its founder, financial mismanagement by its leaders and spiritual abuses by its top members.</p><p>The Sodalitium on Monday confirmed the dissolution, which was conveyed to an assembly of its members in Aparecida, Brazil at the weekend by the pope’s top legal adviser, Cardinal Gianfranco Ghirlanda. In revealing the dissolution in a statement, the group lamented that news of Francis’s decision had been leaked by two members attending the assembly, who were “definitively expelled”.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/20/pope-dissolves-sodalitium-of-christian-life-peru-catholic-movement-vatican-investigation\">Continue reading...</a>",

He made the comment in an interview with Dan Walker for 5 News being broadcast tonight. Farage told Walker he did genuinely believe he could be the next PM. And this is what he said when he was asked if that could happen during Trump’s presidency.</p><p>Look, Labour have got a whopping great big majority. The only thing that really brings an early election is if we get an economic meltdown.</p><p>Now, that is not impossible for two reasons. One, the level of indebtedness is worse than it was in 2008 when we had the big meltdowns. And I think we’ve lived through rocketing stock markets for years. That can’t go on.</p><p>For Reform to replace the Tories three things would need to happen. First they would need to sustain their current momentum well into 2025, then there would need to be a tipping point moment when donors, right-wing media and a number of Tory MPs decided to shift support en masse, and then they would have to win more seats in the 2028/2029 election.</p><p>The first of these seems fairly likely. The enthusiasm of Reform’s voter base, the weakness of the Tory party, and the media need for narrative all point the same way. The biggest barrier is probably Farage’s ability to manage the negative associations caused by Musk (<a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/50340-elon-musks-favourability-remains-unchanged-after-the-riots-but-xs-reputation-continues-to-decline\">who is not at all popular in the UK</a>).</p><p>It may take a long time but if - and it is a big if - Reform remain a major player in British politics, under the voting system we have, it will ultimately lead to the end of the Tory party as we know it.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/20/us-chagos-islands-deal-david-lammy-uk-politics-live-news-updates\">Continue reading...</a>",

In some places maximum temperatures are expected to drop by 15-20C over just a couple of days in contrast to above average temperatures in parts of the US earlier last week.</p><p>The rapid change in conditions is due to winds in the upper atmosphere weakening and meandering. At about six miles above the Earth’s surface there is a strong circulation known as the polar vortex around the north pole, which usually helps to keep cold air trapped there. However, late last week and early this week the circulation has been weakening and meandering, allowing a cold plume of air to be brought in from the north. Temperatures across central and eastern parts of the US are forecast to be 10-15C below average, with New York likely to see temperatures struggling to get out of negative double digits during daytime. As the cold air pushes in from the north, an area of low pressure will develop in the warmer gulf of Mexico, these two air masses will then clash across states bordering the Gulf of Mexico, bringing heavy rain and snow to areas that rarely see any. This cold spell is expected to last until the weekend, when temperatures will slowly start returning to around average.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jan/20/weather-tracker-polar-vortex-severe-cold-spell-us\">Continue reading...</a>",

Electoral reform is the best way to protect it</p><p>Inauguration day in the US signalled the drum beat of the far right sweeping across western democracies. According to Sadiq Khan, now is the time to be “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/18/sadiq-khan-warns-western-democracy-at-risk-from-resurgent-fascism-ahead-of-trump-inauguration\">unflinching in defence</a> of our democracy and values”. Rightly, Khan warned that “the spectre of a resurgent fascism haunts the west” as Europe’s hard-right politicians, including some from Britain, gathered in Washington to welcome the new president.</p><p>Mayors are in a unique position: they can give voice to what many think but the government cannot say, bound as it is by diplomacy and trade links. Protecting democracy, Khan said, will mean ministers must “ratchet up” pressure on social media companies to stop “a billionaire bully” using his social media platform to amplify lies and “advance the cause of the far right”. Yes indeed – let’s do that.</p><p>Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/21/donald-trump-uk-far-right-electoral-reform-keir-starmer\">Continue reading...</a>",

She is now routinely described as “embattled” or – even more dreaded label – “beleaguered”. So I thought it polite to ask how she was feeling. “I’m very well, actually,” she responded and hit me with a smile so wide and beaming that she could find alternative employment advertising toothpaste.</p><p>Being chancellor is not just a numbers game. It is as much, if not more, a confidence game. The chief financial officer can never afford to look rattled about the balance sheet or fretful about the vultures circling their position. The more reason they have to feel anxious, the more imperative it is that they look nerveless. That she understands. “It’s a tough gig, but there’s no one tougher than Rachel,” says one of her admirers in the cabinet.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/19/keir-starmer-rachel-reeves-economy\">Continue reading...</a>",

And once again the Democrats have egg on their faces</p><p>Politics in the US has had its fair share of stupid moments, but the recent banning and (sort of) unbanning of TikTok may rank as one of the stupidest. At the same time, the episode neatly encapsulates the current moment: it’s a perfect example of Donald Trump’s showmanship, the Democrats’ incompetence and the limits of bipartisanship. If I were a TikTok teen I’d come up with some sort of experimental dance to illustrate these themes but I’m old and completely devoid of rhythm, so words are going to have to suffice.</p><p>Let’s start with Trump, who, with his usual talent for self-promotion, has positioned himself as the guy who brought TikTok back from the dead, despite being responsible for signing its death warrant in the first place. To refresh everyone’s memory, in 2020 Trump issued vaguely worded <a href=\"https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-addressing-threat-posed-tiktok/\">executive orders</a> that described TikTok and WeChat as threats to national security. There doesn’t seem to be much evidence, <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2021/03/tiktok-vs-douyin-security-privacy-analysis/\">by the way</a>, that TikTok is any more of a threat to national security than any of the other data-sucking apps we all have on our phones. The main argument from its critics seems to be that it has Chinese owners – and they’re <em>clearly</em> not going to be responsible stewards of people’s data in the way that Americans such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election\">Mark Zuckerberg</a> are.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/21/tiktok-ban-trump-trumptok-us-politics\">Continue reading...</a>",

I feel myself blush. I’m wearing a mint-green tulle midi dress with sheer sleeves that balloon precociously and a tiered skirt that puffs out in such a way as to give me the appearance of either a Quality Street or a three-year-old at her own birthday party. It’s not, if I’m entirely honest, the most practical of outfits for serving chocolate cake to 18 sticky-handed toddlers but, as I blurt out to my friend, keen to dispel any confusion, the avant-garde look wasn’t actually my choice: it was AI’s.</p><p>I love quirky clothes. Different cuts, unusual fabrics, bold colours, exciting textures. My wardrobe is my identity, my refuge, my hobby, my happy place. Or, at least, it was. Recently – since having my second baby – I’ve struggled to get dressed. Paralysed by choice, I am beset by decision fatigue every time I approach my (admittedly groaning) closet. With a three-year-old and a six-month-old to wrangle into clobber, too, the overwhelm has joined forces with lack of time. This morning I was hurling clothes at my body while the youngest screamed for his nap. The steady spoliation of my personal style continues apace, now stained with breast milk and squashed banana.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/19/would-you-let-ai-choose-your-outfits\">Continue reading...</a>",

But last Monday he broke the habit of a lifetime in a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-on-ai-opportunities-action-plan-13-january-2025\">speech delivered at University College London</a>. It was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/artificialintelligenceai\">about AI</a>, which he sees as “the defining opportunity of our generation”. The UK, he declared “is the nation of Babbage, Lovelace and Turing”, not to mention the country “that gave birth to the modern computer and the world wide web. So mark my words – Britain will be one of the great AI superpowers.”</p><p>Stirring stuff, eh. Within days of taking office, the PM had invited Matt Clifford, a smart tech bro from central casting, to think about “how we seize the opportunities of AI”. Clifford came up with a 50-point <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-opportunities-action-plan/ai-opportunities-action-plan\">AI Opportunities Action Plan</a> that Starmer accepted in its entirety, saying that he would “put the full weight of the British state” behind it. He also appointed Clifford as his <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/appointment-of-matt-clifford-cbe-as-the-ai-opportunities-adviser\">AI Opportunities Adviser</a> to oversee implementation of the plan and report directly to him. It’s only a matter of time before the <em>Sun</em> dubs him “the UK’s AI tsar”.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/19/cringing-before-the-tech-giants-is-no-way-to-make-britain-an-ai-superpower\">Continue reading...</a>",

            "subline": "<p>Musk desperately wants to appropriate gamer credibility, but he may be faking it – and doing exactly what toxic nerds have been accusing women of doing for decades</p><p>Last year on Joe Rogan’s podcast, Elon Musk claimed to be one of the world’s best Diablo IV players – and surprisingly, the leaderboards backed him up. For those that haven’t had the pleasure, Diablo is one of the most mercilessly time-intensive video games out there; you build a character and carve through armies of demons, spending hundreds of hours refining skills and equipment for maximum hellspawn-cleansing efficiency. I played it for maybe five hours last year and immediately quit, for fear that it would consume my life. Most of the people who play it are young, often male, and have plenty of time to themselves to spend on the internet and playing games – so, the exact demographic of many Musk stans.</p><p>It suited these hardcore gamer guys to believe that someone who tweets all day and runs several businesses was also an elite player who poured hundreds of hours into Diablo. This made him relatable. It fed into his preferred image of being the hardest-working man alive. But then Elon made the mistake of actually playing a game live on X, and it became clear very quickly that something was amiss. It seems Elon Musk might be a <em>fake gamer</em>.<br><br>\n On 7 January, Musk played Path of Exile 2, a very Diablo-like hack-and-slash game that came out towards the end of last year. His character was extremely well-equipped; suspiciously so. Viewers noted that he had better gear than some of the professional streamers who play this game all day every day, and he didn’t seem to know what their stats meant. I have not played Path of Exile 2 and so I can’t independently assess these claims – unlike Musk, apparently, I am quite happy to admit when I’m not an expert on a particular game – but within a few hours the many inconsistencies in his play and commentary were laid out exactingly <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExile2/comments/1hwxc17/documenting_the_saga_of_elon_musks_account/\">on Reddit</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lz_o1dzWKvM&amp;ab_channel=Empyriangaming\">in YouTube videos</a>. (He also posted a suspiciously rubbish <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1528955104463814656\">Elden Ring build</a> back in 2022, which was dredged up as further evidence.) Evidently Musk forgot that we nerds are known for our attention to detail.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jan/20/elon-musk-stands-accused-of-pretending-to-be-good-at-video-games-the-irony-is-delicious\">Continue reading...</a>",

He called it Nintendo – a phrase whose meaning is lost to time according to Nintendo’s own historians, but which can be translated as “leave luck up to heaven”. In the 1970s, Nintendo eventually transitioned from paper games to electronic ones, making its own luck in the process. It has been a permanent fixture in living rooms across the world ever since.</p><p>For budding artist Takaya Imamura, an art student who had been captivated by Metroid and Super Mario Bros 3 in the 1980s, working at Nintendo was a dream. “Back in 1985 when Super Mario came out in Japan, everybody was playing it,” he recalls. “I was at an art university, studying design at the time.

I would not be the first to point out that there is some conflict in the fact that <em>we, </em>the viewers, are watching all these competitors get killed for <em>our </em>entertainment, but still: despite the violence, despite the shock value, there is no ambiguity around the narrative intention.</p><p>In this spin-off video game from Netflix, by contrast, the games are <em>not </em>bad. They are supposed to be fun. You run around colourful obstacle courses trying to kill as many of your fellow players as possible to advance yourself to the next round, their cartoon avatars crumpling comically when stabbed or burned or shot only to respawn seconds later. When you win, you get money and tokens to buy new zany outfits for your vacantly smiling character, and then you go again. In this madcap tumble, the message of the TV show is … rather lost.

It would star the series’ most theatrical, violent villain, Goro “Mad Dog” Majima, as a pirate with amnesia, and it was called Project Madlantis. This leak went under the radar, quite possibly because it sounded so silly that nobody would believe it. But then, at 2024’s Tokyo Game Show in September, Sega surprised everyone by announcing exactly this. It is called Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. That’s it. That’s the game.</p><p>Madlantis sounds like a theme night at a noughties student bar, but is in fact the game’s pirate hub, a nautical Vegas where captains battle and bet on each other in coliseum face-offs. Ships are outfitted with cannon and pistols, but also machine guns and rocket launchers. Sailing the seas around Hawaii, avoiding lightning strikes during storms, Captain Majima can let go of the wheel of the ship and heft an RPG on to his shoulder to blow up an enemy craft. Boarding another vessel results in a fight between crews, which, given all the tricorn hats and outlandish costumes, looks like a punch-up between a bunch of extras from an 80s music video.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jan/16/pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-is-an-early-contender-for-2025s-silliest-game\">Continue reading...</a>",

The controllers can be used like a mouse, or held in the hands like a traditional joypad, and also have motion-control functionality.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jan/16/nintendo-announces-its-next-console-the-switch-2\">Continue reading...</a>",

Despite having lived almost as far back as seems possible, Luca was surprisingly similar to modern bacteria – and what’s more, it apparently lived in a thriving community of other organisms that have left no trace on Earth today.</p><p>Luca – short for the last universal common ancestor, the progenitor of all known life on Earth – seems to have been born 4.2bn years ago. Back then our planet was no Eden but something of a hell on Earth: a seething mass of volcanoes pummelled by giant meteorites, and having recovered from a cosmic collision that blasted the world apart and created the moon from some of the fragments. There is good reason why the geological aeon before 4bn years ago is called the Hadean, after the Greek god of the underworld Hades.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/jan/19/luca-is-the-progenitor-of-all-life-on-earth-but-its-genesis-has-implications-far-beyond-our-planet\">Continue reading...</a>",

Viewing a scene through the eyes of an antagonist – such as the <a href=\"http://www.diegesismagazine.com/throughtheeyesofevil.html\">extended opening</a> of John Carpenter’s Halloween – can be a chilling way of drawing viewers into the action, making us feel like we are both the watcher and being watched. When combined with sustained shots without an edit, we become eavesdroppers and voyeurs, lingering long past when the scene should have moved on. From Hitchcock’s Rear Window to Haneke’s Hidden, a camera that holds it gaze can fill us with a creeping sense of dread.</p><p>Presence uses both tricks, telling us a familiar story (a family with baggage move into a haunted house) in an unfamiliar way. Told from the perspective of a ghostly presence, we witness every scene via the point-of-view shot, sweeping between rooms to hear intimate conversations and hovering over characters as they sleep. As the ghost we watch through upstairs windows, peer round closet doors, and recede into corners while scenes unfold.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/21/are-you-being-watched-soderberghs-ghost-voyeur-movie-taps-scientific-truth\">Continue reading...</a>",

It has now jumped into more than <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10902543/\">48 species</a> of mammals, from bears to dairy cows, causing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/sep/04/forgotten-epidemic-with-over-280-million-birds-dead-how-is-the-avian-flu-outbreak-evolving\">mass die-offs</a> in sea lions and elephant seal pups.

We head to Zurich’s secret vault and meet the dealers</p><p>There’s a secrecy to the specifics of our planned rendezvous, when I meet a sharp-suited Egon von Greyerz in Zurich airport’s arrivals hall. Hands shaken, he guides us out of a side entrance towards a car park in a quiet corner of the sprawling complex. Roughly 30,000 people work in and around the site; annually, tens of millions of passengers pass through here. Scarce few are aware of the existence, let alone the precise location, of our intended destination: a high-security, 350sqm vault somewhere deep beneath us. Inside it, vast quantities of gold, much of it belonging to von Greyerz, and a roster of his company’s exceedingly wealthy international clientele.</p><p>For more than 25 years, von Greyerz has been in this business: buying, selling and storing precious metals for the super-rich, all the while preaching his golden gospel. “We set certain minimum levels,” he says, “to invest through us: $400,000 to store gold in this Zurich vault, or our similar one in Singapore. We use another deep in the Swiss Alps: you’ll need to invest $5m to have anything there.”</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/19/the-new-gold-rush-why-the-precious-metal-has-lost-none-of-its-allure\">Continue reading...</a>",

Her vision for reform involves closer coordination with the NHS, enhanced support for people who are economically inactive, and stronger local oversight of job centres and training. In November, she set out her ambition for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/24/uk-jobcentres-not-fit-for-purpose-says-liz-kendall-ahead-of-major-reforms\">“genuine public employment service”</a>, including work coaches to support people through the transition back into work.</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The local council had found them a privately rented flat with an agreed rent, and provided a “landlord incentive” payment of £1,500. But, when the council emailed the landlord to confirm the arrangements, he replied to say that he was increasing the rent by £100 a month because “the market is moving in that direction”.</p><p>The property was mortgage-free, so the price hike could not be blamed on rising costs. This is not uncommon: <a href=\"https://www.zoopla.co.uk/discover/property-news/how-higher-mortgage-rates-are-hitting-landlords/\">Zoopla estimates</a> that 70% of landlords have either no debt or a small mortgage. Nor was there some sort of supply shock:<strong> </strong>the council’s statistics showed that many thousands of homes in the local area (more than 8%) were sitting empty. The flat was not suddenly in a nicer location, nor in a better condition than before. The rent had gone up simply because there was nothing to stop the landlord from naming his price.</p><p>Nick Bano is a barrister specialising in renters’ rights and homelessness law and the author of Against Landlords: How to Solve the Housing Crisi<em>s</em> (Verso, £16.99).

During the 2023 season, not long after she had stood as the No 2 player in the world, Badosa suffered a stress fracture in her back that had left her in significant pain and forced her to withdraw from every grand slamthat year. By last March, the 27-year-old was fighting for her future.</p><p>The initial resolution was cortisone injections to manage the immediate pain and inflammation, allowing her to return to the tour even though her long-term future remained uncertain.

United finished last in the First Division at the end of the 1930-31 season, winning seven games, losing their opening 12, conceding 115 goals, the manager Herbert Bamlett, better known as a referee, sacked with six fixtures to play. The previous owner, John Henry Davies, who had funded the Mangnall years, had died in 1927, stretching finances. According to the author Eamon Dunphy, the final game, with Middlesbrough, drew 3,900 to Old Trafford, an “uncanny atmosphere” with “the shouts of derision echoing through the empty grandstand”. United would spend the next couple of seasons fighting off relegation to the Third Division North.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/20/are-the-class-of-2025-really-the-worst-manchester-united-team-of-all-time\">Continue reading...</a>",

Back in November, it was his effort that wrapped up a 3-1 win over Lyon II, <em>Les Gones’ </em>reserve side, in the National 3. On Wednesday, he repeated the feat against Lyon’s first team, scoring the first goal in the penalty shootout as fifth-tier side Bourgoin-Jallieu sent last year’s finalists crashing out of the Coupe de France.</p><p>It was Lyon fan and Groupama Stadium regular Mehdi Moujetzky’s brace that took the game to extra time and then Bozkurt’s calmly taken spot-kick that got the ball rolling in the shootout before misses from academy products Alexandre Lacazette and Corentin Tolisso saw the minnows advance. “We will have to face our shame, to those close to us, to those who love the club, to our managers, to everyone,” said Pierre Sage, who didn’t warm to the storyline. “The magic of the cup?

            "subline": "<p>Praise rarely comes striker’s way but after match-winning hat-trick at Betis, cult hero was showered with it</p><p>This could have only felt more right if you read about it on Teletext. On Saturday afternoon Kike García, the 6ft 1in, 12 stone, 35-year-old Deportivo Alavés centre-forward with a bit of the 80s about him, a player from the recent past who doesn’t always get a lot of goals but always gives every little thing he has got, scored the perfect hat-trick to defeat Real Betis 3-1. Right foot, left foot, header and the lovable lump from La Mancha who everyone assumes is Basque, all mud and guts, the man whose coach once called him a “hard-working oaf”, left the Benito Villamarín with the match ball under his arm, something for the cabinet at home. But that, he said, was not the best thing about it, not now, and he meant it too, which is the best thing about him.</p><p>“I’m not Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi; they’ll have 900 of these,” García said, exaggerating just a weensy bit, when another battle was over for another week and victory was secure at last, the bus waiting outside to head back to Vitoria, a few beers on board. Between them, <em>those two</em> have actually scored 80 in La Liga alone; as for García, in a 16-year career that has taken in <em>tercera</em>, <em>segunda</em> b, and <em>segunda</em>, that led him to the Championship with Middlesbrough, and didn’t reach <em>primera</em> until he was 27, until now he had only two: for Real Murcia against Mirandés a decade ago, and for Eibar against Alavés in 2021. That said, the second of those might just have been the best hat-trick La Liga has ever seen – you can insert your own <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/mar/18/oh-my-god-lionel-messi-hat-trick-stadium-left-in-suspended-animation-barcelona\">apart from Messi</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/mar/18/oh-my-god-lionel-messi-hat-trick-stadium-left-in-suspended-animation-barcelona\"> asterisk here</a>, and Rivaldo would certainly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/jun/19/europeanfootball.sport\">like a word</a> – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/03/la-liga-eibar-alaves-kike-garcia-relegation-battle-sid-lowe\">three goals that filled an empty ground</a>, bringing a little hope where there was none.

            "subline": "<p>Ruben Amorim thinks so, but other managers have faced similar struggles. Here is a trip down memory lane to some of the worst crises at Old Trafford …</p><p>If United’s current state feels like a lost decade, then the 1930s were its progenitor, much of it spent in the second tier, fans yearning for the early 1900s glory years under Ernest Mangnall, one of only three United managers – with Matt Busby and Alex Ferguson – to win the league title. United finished last in the First Division at the end of the 1930-31 season, winning seven games, losing their opening 12, conceding 115 goals, the manager Herbert Bamlett, better known as a referee, sacked with six fixtures to play. The previous owner, John Henry Davies, who had funded the Mangnall years, had died in 1927, stretching finances. According to the author Eamon Dunphy, the final game, with Middlesbrough, drew 3,900 to Old Trafford, an “uncanny atmosphere” with “the shouts of derision echoing through the empty grandstand”. United would spend the next couple of seasons fighting off relegation to the Third Division North.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/20/are-the-class-of-2025-really-the-worst-manchester-united-team-of-all-time\">Continue reading...</a>",

Taylor lamented his team’s poor execution of such passes, saying: “The timing was wrong, our decision-making was wrong, the movement to receive was off, we were playing the passes too late or too soon. [But] as much as United were aggressive, I still think it was us playing into their hands and little bit, and we needed to be smarter.” Taylor said that, when his team did try to play long balls, Manchester United were “mopping it up” and so he insisted his team would not simply give up on their style, adding: “We are not going to become, certainly in my reign, a team that will smash the ball long and play long kind of percentage football.” <strong>TG</strong></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/20/womens-super-league-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action\">Continue reading...</a>",

Back in November, it was his effort that wrapped up a 3-1 win over Lyon II, <em>Les Gones’ </em>reserve side, in the National 3. On Wednesday, he repeated the feat against Lyon’s first team, scoring the first goal in the penalty shootout as fifth-tier side Bourgoin-Jallieu sent last year’s finalists crashing out of the Coupe de France.</p><p>It was Lyon fan and Groupama Stadium regular Mehdi Moujetzky’s brace that took the game to extra time and then Bozkurt’s calmly taken spot-kick that got the ball rolling in the shootout before misses from academy products Alexandre Lacazette and Corentin Tolisso saw the minnows advance. “We will have to face our shame, to those close to us, to those who love the club, to our managers, to everyone,” said Pierre Sage, who didn’t warm to the storyline. “The magic of the cup?

After 22 games of that season, Arsenal topped the table on goal difference from Leicester with Manchester City a point back and Tottenham four behind them. It was the following weekend that Leicester began to take control of the league, as they beat Stoke, Manchester City drew at West Ham and Arsenal lost at home to Chelsea. Wins over Manchester City and Liverpool in their following two games consolidated a lead that they never surrendered.</p><p>It’s not to diminish Leicester’s achievement to point out that they benefited from a number of elite sides having disappointing seasons: Arsenal came second <a href=\"https://www.premierleague.com/history/season-reviews/42\">with only 71 points</a>. The theory then was that the general wealth of the Premier League – the fact that, to use Deloitte’s figures from 2024, Aston Villa, Brighton, Fulham, Leeds, Crystal Palace and Everton are among the 30 wealthiest clubs in the world by revenue – meant that the elite were facing too consistent a challenge for 85-plus points in a season to be a viable target every year.

A recognition, perhaps, that the team he is now responsible for are facing a long, hard winter.</p><p>Being caught on the hop for a first game away loss, as Union were at Schmidt’s Heidenheim, is one thing. But 21 years after his last appearance for Union as a player, Baumgart made his home debut as head coach on Wednesday evening, and given the anticipation on all sides, this was probably even more deflating than Saturday’s comprehensive 2-0 away defeat. He had spoken about how he had never really had the Union job in his career plan as his feeling for the club would just make it mean too much. The 53-year-old wears his heart on his sleeve, even for a coach, and now he has the task of trying to keep the capital club in the division, it’s going to be an emotional rollercoaster.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/16/steffen-baumgart-union-berlin-fight-bundesliga-survival\">Continue reading...</a>",

One of our greats. Yet few fans have specific memories of him playing. Not necessarily because we didn’t see him play, just because he went about it so quietly. He wasn’t known for dashing overlaps or canny underlaps; flair or vision; passing or dribbling. And he certainly wasn’t known for his goals, though he did score four – or was it five – in his 315 games. Booky was a solid, tough-tackling right-back with a fair bit of pace, despite looking as if he should be on standby for a Dad’s Army XI.</p><p>When we were kids, City fans wanted to be Franny Lee, “King” Colin Bell or Mike “Buzzer” Summerbee. Nobody wanted to be Book. Yet his was the most remarkable story by far. Anthony Keith Book, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/14/tony-book-manchester-city-dies-aged-90\">died this week aged 90</a>, represented possibility. The triumph of hope over expectation. The ultimate football dream. Take an ageing brickie off the building site and turn him into a top-class footballer at an age when most players were thinking of retiring. The fact that he wasn’t phenomenally gifted made it all the more romantic.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/15/the-amazing-manchester-city-career-of-tony-book-from-a-building-site-to-the-title\">Continue reading...</a>",

The frame was still rattling several seconds later.</p><p>So, here’s a thought exercise. What are the consequences if Porro’s shot goes in? Does it make this Tottenham team any better? Does it change our assessment of their season so far? Does it render the club any better run or better coached? It shouldn’t, right?

Sign up now!</a></strong></p><p>Ruben Amorim’s idea of a good headline is unlikely to earn him a senior editorial position at the home of such front-page zingers as “WORLD WAR 2 BOMBER FOUND ON MOON” and “STATUE OF ELVIS FOUND ON MOON” that is the Sunday Sport. However, since arriving in England the Manchester United manager has taken it upon himself to make the working lives of the Manchester press pack easier, when perhaps he might be better advised to deal with some of the many shambles they have been forced to report on from Old Trafford this season that fall within his remit.</p><p>I’m ready to get training and get in the ring. I’ve always been interested in having boxing matches. But every time it’s come up, it’s either not been the right time or the right opponent. I’m 44 years old. I always tell my kids to step out of their comfort zone, so let’s have a go. I haven’t watched loads of [KSI]. I’ve seen a few clips away from the fights. I know he’s a YouTuber, but that’s more for the younger generation. I won’t watch him” – former Chelsea and England left-back Wayne Bridge might not have the pay-per-view pulling power of Mike Tyson, but he’s the latest sportsman way past his peak to agree to a naff bout with a social media abomination to get some online clicks. After bringing up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/03/betrayal-and-bombast-surreal-story-terry-v-bridge-scandal\">some history</a>, the ‘fight’ now takes place in Manchester on 29 March.</p><p>Remember around a decade ago when Armando Iannucci said that ‘The Thick of It’ couldn’t return as politics had got so ridiculous that it was impossible to satirise it? Increasingly, I think that about Football Daily with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/19/ruben-amorim-says-team-worst-maybe-in-the-history-of-manchester-united\" title=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/19/ruben-amorim-says-team-worst-maybe-in-the-history-of-manchester-united\">Manchester United</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/19/everton-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/19/everton-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\">Spurs</a>” – Noble Francis.</p><p>Ruben Amorim, or more likely the person who fed him the question, doesn’t know his history. This isn’t even 1973-74 United, well done for both bringing <em>that</em> up and then tiptoeing around the subject this weekend, but 1980-81 United, a collection of underperforming stalwarts who’d won the odd FA Cup, underperforming youth signings, anticipated, but yes, underperforming foreign signings and Garry <em>Bloody</em> Birtles, who gave a masterclass in mediocre to a constant media chunter. (Eighth in the league and lost to Widzew Lodz, since you ask). This was, I recall, about the time from which every commentator was constantly obliged to remind you that they hadn’t won the title since 1967, as if calendars were as rare in 1980s Britain as secure work, money and civil rights for minority groups. At least that’s changed, eh?” – Jon Millard.</p><p>TS Eliot may have thought April was the cruellest month, but he wasn’t au fait with modern football management. I reckon that, reading up the table, Southampton, Leicester and Manchester United might decide they are no longer starry-eyed and laughing (the real poet of the 20th/21st centuries) about their recent managerial appointments and that we could see a possibly-unprecedented three clubs change managers twice in a season? Throw in Ange Postecoglou and January could well surpass April in cruelty” – Richard Hirst.</p><p><em><strong>This is an extract from our daily football email … Football Daily.

Recent Manchester United performances of the resurrected Harry Maguire in tandem with Lisandro Martínez and Matthijs de Ligt suggest it can work if with sufficient energy in midfield to protect the trio. Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo offer that, and the wing play of Alejandro Garnacho in setting up Bruno Fernandes’s goal, plus Amad Diallo’s raiding runs at the Emirates Stadium, suggest the framework of a team. Penalty hero Altay Bayindir revealed he is a capable goalkeeper, a possible cult hero. There are complications. The club’s finances, chickens of the Glazer ownership now coming home to roost, may trigger selling “pure profit” youth products like Garnacho and Mainoo to fund recruitment. There are significant miles to travel, but the previous weekend’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/05/liverpool-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">draw at Anfield</a>, and this 10-man heist at Arsenal are signs of a motivated team playing for their manager, closely following instructions.

He now has 23 first-team appearances and has established himself as a starter and one of the most talented young players in Europe. “I’m still learning a lot tactically,” he said in August. “There is a very big difference between youth and professional football. Making the right movements and creating space for myself and others is what I still need to learn the most.</p><p>A tumultuous year for the young American who was caught in the crossfire of a feud between his own family and the USMNT coach, Gregg Berhalter, after the World Cup, during which he played a mere 52 minutes of the US’s four games.

            "subline": "<p>The wildly popular gameshow has torn up its genre’s rulebook to become one of the best things on television. Its secret? Letting us indulge our fantasies of treachery</p><p>In the latest episode of The Traitors UK, the final eight players gathered at a candlelit dinner party. After weeks of fraught gameplay, they shared what they would do with the prize money if they were to win. Their teary stories were emotional: donations to disability charities, IVF journeys, putting kids through university and long-overdue honeymoons. The message was clear: these are <em>good</em> people. But suddenly, the game recommenced and we once again wondered: <em>are they?</em></p><p>“To finish that dinner and say goodnight to everyone, knowing one of them might be ‘murdered’ that night …” says Minah Shannon, one of the titular traitors who will be secretly deciding which faithfuls to kill off that night, before breaking out into laughter. “Oh my god, I’m a psychopath!” Alongside her fellow traitors, the 29-year-old call centre manager from Liverpool has betrayed and backstabbed her way through the game. But far from being considered a villain, she has become a fan favourite. This surprising turn is mostly down to the format of The Traitors. For its viewers, the show upends the usual experience of watching a reality TV show – and that’s what makes it so captivating.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jan/21/how-the-traitors-revolutionised-reality-tv-for-the-secretly-evil\">Continue reading...</a>",

Often fanned by the Santa Anas, gales known as the “devil winds,” they spark easily in the long, hot months of summer and autumn. But on 7 January, when those winds blew at 85 mph through areas parched from winter drought, a hurricane of fire swept into lower-lying – and densely populated – areas that had never seen such blazes before. The flames incinerated thousands of homes and priceless cultural heritage, marking the worst natural disaster in LA history. The second largest city in the US and a global cultural capital – home to the Hollywood film industry and a rich contemporary art scene – may never be the same again.</p><p>More than a week on, with the Eaton fire 81% contained and the massive Palisades fire only 52% contained, the LA arts community is still taking stock of the losses. Altadena, a middle-class residential neighbourhood that is home to many artists, was particularly devastated by the Eaton Fire. According to artist <a href=\"http://www.andrewkreps.com/artists/andrea-bowers\">Andrea Bowers</a>, 190 artists have lost or suffered significant damage to their homes, studios, and work. That figure comes from <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-rebuild-the-lives-of-las-artists-and-art-workers\">Grief and Hope</a>, a survey and relief fund Bowers launched on 9 January with several other arts professionals, including fellow artist <a href=\"https://www.davidkordanskygallery.com/artist/kathryn-andrews\">Kathryn Andrews</a>, who lost her home to the Palisades fire. The tally continues to rise.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jan/21/landmarks-destroyed-masterpieces-incinerated-communities-razed-how-the-la-fires-ravaged-culture\">Continue reading...</a>",

He was obsessed with that 2003 film, he remembers, but his younger sister Cécile and her generation had other fandoms: “Not Nirvana now, but Radiohead; and not The Matrix, but The Lord of the Rings. There were only two years between them, but that might have been enough to explain the difference, things still moved quite quickly in those days, much less quickly than in the 1960s, of course, or even in the 1970s, the deceleration and immobilisation of the west, heralding its annihilation, had been progressive.”</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jan/21/orgies-vampires-tortoises-myths-decadence-art\">Continue reading...</a>",

Viewing a scene through the eyes of an antagonist – such as the <a href=\"http://www.diegesismagazine.com/throughtheeyesofevil.html\">extended opening</a> of John Carpenter’s Halloween – can be a chilling way of drawing viewers into the action, making us feel like we are both the watcher and being watched. When combined with sustained shots without an edit, we become eavesdroppers and voyeurs, lingering long past when the scene should have moved on. From Hitchcock’s Rear Window to Haneke’s Hidden, a camera that holds it gaze can fill us with a creeping sense of dread.</p><p>Presence uses both tricks, telling us a familiar story (a family with baggage move into a haunted house) in an unfamiliar way. Told from the perspective of a ghostly presence, we witness every scene via the point-of-view shot, sweeping between rooms to hear intimate conversations and hovering over characters as they sleep. As the ghost we watch through upstairs windows, peer round closet doors, and recede into corners while scenes unfold.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/21/are-you-being-watched-soderberghs-ghost-voyeur-movie-taps-scientific-truth\">Continue reading...</a>",

She was not famous like Simone but she was every bit as radical and prolific, as both a feminist and a painter. It seems ridiculous that history would have sidelined this woman whose work Picasso complimented at her first Paris show in 1936, calling it “original”. She was also president of a women’s refuge, and signed 1971’s influential Manifesto of the 343 Women, in which the signatories all admitted to having had an illegal abortion. Hélène even declared herself a feminist before Simone.</p><p>Now, with a show of her paintings opening at the Amar Gallery in London, the record is being set straight, as Hélène finally receives the recognition many feel she is due. “Our whole mission,” says gallerist Amar Singh, “is to search for overlooked artists.” Singh regales me with tales of cross-continental wild goose chases on the trail of collectors who <em>might</em> just sell. Once he hits upon an artist, he says, he looks into why they may have been sidelined. “It is always,” says the gallerist, “down to gender, race or sexuality.”</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jan/20/helene-de-beauvoir-sister-simone-picasso-jean-paul-sartre\">Continue reading...</a>",

From Pokémon to the multimillion-selling PlayStation Final Fantasy games, there was nothing cooler than vanquishing blocky beasts via drop down menus. Then came the new millennium. As computing power blossomed and western-made games rose in popularity, traditional Japanese-made RPGs slowly but surely fell out of fashion.</p><p>“What Final Fantasy was doing before – a more realistic, grounded take on the turn-based genre – now, nobody is doing that. And that’s where we want to be,” says Guillaume Broche, CEO of Sandfall Interactive and creative director of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Citing 2007’s Xbox 360 classic Lost Odyssey as the last truly high-budget turn-based RPG, the ex Ubisoft employee founded a studio with a mission to move the genre forward.</p><p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 will be released on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox in summer 2025</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jan/01/games-to-look-forward-to-in-2025-clair-obscur-expedition-33\">Continue reading...</a>",

Taking place over two days, what the film captures, without overtly talking about it too much, is his father’s experience of dementia, and the gradual dismantling of the intellectual faculties that have been so important to him throughout his life. In a sense the film is about the process of erosion: dementia is not a fixed state condition, but a gradual slippage, and not even a linear slippage at that. Horst has better days and some memories that remain clear, even as other important facets of his life trickle away from him like sand in an hourglass.</p><p>Horst’s house is the main location for the film and functions as a visual metaphor for his condition. He shares it with his wife, and it has lapsed into a state of genteel disrepair, half of a shabby-chic dichotomy where the shabby is gradually encroaching, bit by bit, on the chic. There are whole walls full of beautiful books, the fruits of an academic life, but there are also strips of wallpaper peeling off the wall. Hutter includes plenty of shots of nice tasteful furniture cluttered with badly organised paperwork, an evocation of a life that still has much of the outward shape and structure it always did, but whose internal organisational principles have begun to go awry.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/21/up-the-river-with-acid-review-intimate-abstract-portrait-of-a-fathers-dementia\">Continue reading...</a>",

Its recent phase been more samey, and reliant on her now-signature trick: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/09/nina-conti-edinburgh-fringe-in-your-face-interview\">turning volunteers into human ventriloquist’s dummies</a>, and animating them in improvised scenes onstage. Her touring show Whose Face Is It Anyway? cleaves to the formula, which is no bad thing. What returning Conti-watchers lose in novelty, we gain in seeing a master back at work, elevating her brand of off-the-cuff voice-throwing and organised havoc to a state of near comedy grace.</p><p>Part of the trick is selecting stooges, and the show starts with old-fashioned crowdwork – led by Conti, with backchat from her glove-puppet simian. Conti’s been telling some of these jokes, and feigning surprise at Monkey’s indiscretions, for decades, but she does it artfully, loosening up her crowd and hoarding intel on prospective co-stars for the stunts to come. The first is a Sainsbury’s checkout assistant invited onstage to discuss her lax approach to shop security. Next are two PE-teacher sisters, who sing us a song about the ballet they once performed as kids.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ninaontour.com/\">Touring until 10 March</a></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/jan/21/nina-conti-whose-face-is-it-anyway-review-apollo-theatre-london\">Continue reading...</a>",

It’s like the plot was dreamed up by a hack who overheard his six-year-old pitting Lego figurines against one another. You start to expect that any minute Batman or Unikitty will join the fray which – frankly – would be an improvement. What we get instead is tired, cliche-riddled dialogue and bizarre flashbacks in which lead good guy Cassie (Scout Taylor-Compton) remembers how her oceanographer grandpa (Richard Dreyfuss!) encouraged her to face her fears in the water after she witnessed a great white kill her father when she was a kid.</p><p>Now an adult and an expert diver, Cass has returned to the same coastline where daddy got munched, this time with her husband, Gregg (Callum McGowan) who is looking for a shipwreck. Gregg’s old friend Benz (Stuart Townsend) is the captain of the ship they have hired, along with a first mate and some disposable supporting characters who end up as shark bait when feeding time begins. That happens because the ship is overtaken by a bunch of ex-Navy Seals (led by a charisma-free Jon Seda) who press gang Cass, Gregg and the others to dive for some sunken drug parcels.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/21/into-the-deep-review-richard-dreyfuss-brings-the-meaning-to-smugglers-v-sharks-thriller\">Continue reading...</a>",

Frankly, the best thing about it is the location, a <a href=\"http://elsinghall.com/\">stunning medieval mansion called Elsing Hall</a> in Norfolk with romantic moat, arched doorways, and lush gardens. Fittingly, the house serves as a major engine for the plot, with rumours of ghosts and property values both serving as possible explanations for the dramatic shenanigans.</p><p>In the story, decorative but drippy schoolteacher Cass (Minka Kelly) lives in this beautiful pile with her husband Matthew (Dermot Mulroney, strangely inexpressive) who does something vaguely defined in the energy sector. The couple are Americans who have moved in recently and are doing up the property, but they seem to have settled in comfortably with the local Brits; pretty Cass is also quite a favourite with her male secondary school students. One wet and stormy night, she drives home down the lonely lane of the title and sees a vehicle pulled over, but can’t quite make out who it is inside, apart from the fact that it looks like a woman. Instead of stopping to see if anything is wrong, Cass drives on home. This seed of guilt will blossom quickly into a sense of shame when it’s reported the next day that the woman in the other car was a local friend of Cass who was found murdered.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/21/blackwater-lane-review-haunted-mansion-thriller-ba-paris-the-breakdown\">Continue reading...</a>",

Grafted is actually more superficial than Coralie Fargeat’s film in terms of what it says about appearance – but that is somehow fitting and ably concealed by director Sasha Rainbow with a heavy grouting of punky attitude.</p><p>Chinese student Wei (Joyena Sun) arrives in New Zealand as an overseas student low on self-confidence, partly because of her facial birthmark. Her father, who also had one, died conducting experimental grafting research; his brilliant daughter – wanting to make him proud and herself beautiful – resolves to pick up where he left off. After she settles in at the house of her cousin Angela (Jess Hong), she gets her opportunity when she is cherrypicked by sleazy lecturer Paul (Jared Turner) to help out in his lab.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/21/grafted-review-faceoff-style-skin-graft-horror-has-layers-of-punky-attitude\">Continue reading...</a>",

Almost as much of a mystery was his final completed feature: the evil twin of his previous film, Mulholland Drive. As Laura Dern’s hexed actor segues into the character she is playing, this digitally shot rampage down Hollywood’s boulevard of broken dreams dials up the narrative fragmentation of his late period.

Here, however, the tone is lighter and wittier, as the former artist finds being stuck at home caring for her two-year-old son increasingly exhausting and dull. Her pent-up resentment – and the laissez-faire attitude of her husband (Scoot McNairy) – leads her to grow thick hair, a tail and other doggy accoutrements, and embrace her animal nature. More domestic comedy than werewolf chiller, its success rests on the ever excellent Adams’s let-it-all-out performance. <em><br>\n  Friday 24 January, Disney+</em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jan/17/nightbitch-to-back-in-action-the-seven-best-films-to-watch-on-tv-this-week\">Continue reading...</a>",

But will he be allowed to prove this or will his abrasive personality – and the fact that others trying to travel along the same road have clearly been stopped – prevent him from doing so?

But there is one name I always make an exception for: Nicci French, because this husband and wife duo just keep going from strength to strength. Their latest, <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-last-days-of-kira-mullan-9781398524132/\">The Last Days of Kira Mullan</a></strong> (Simon &amp; Schuster), follows Nancy North, who is recovering from a mental breakdown and being cared for solicitously by her boyfriend, Felix, as they move to a new flat in Harlesden, north-west London. She meets her new neighbours – including, briefly, Kira, whom she bumps into the evening before Kira is found dead by her own hand. Nancy, though, doesn’t believe Kira took her own life, and begins investigating when the police quickly close the case.</p><p>The trouble is, nobody takes Nancy seriously. Once people know about her illness, “they look at you in a different way. Every odd thing you do, anything you say, if you get a bit sad, a bit angry, people think that might be a sign of you going crazy again.” As she shouts into the void – “Being angry is not being haywire. Being suspicious is not being paranoid. Wanting answers is not a sign of paranoid delusion” – her life begins to unravel. This is the pair’s 26th novel, and they are still keeping me up far too late, rushing through the pages in a panicky, obsessive fashion as I race to the conclusion.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jan/21/and-thrillers-of-the-month-review-nicci-french-last-days-of-kira-mullan-uketsu-strange-pictures-tom-hindle-death-in-arctic-alice-feeney-beautiful\">Continue reading...</a>",

You probably don’t get asked that question very often. And yet, the characteristic smell of a place seems to contain its special essence. Photos can’t truly bring back the feeling of being there, but smell has that power.</p><p>Our sense of smell develops before we’re born, and it is strongly linked to brain centres associated with creating new memories and perceiving emotions and&nbsp;bodily sensations. As a result, smells can merge these together, forming vividly personal memories. Most of us have smells that act as a trigger, transporting us to another time and place; for some it is the ocean breeze in summer, for others it might be urban smells of coffee houses, exhaust fumes or a hot pavement on a sunny day. I remember moving to Chicago after completing my PhD in Sweden 15 years ago. In the taxi from the train station, amid the gloomy midwestern winter, I realised the entire city was doused in the most&nbsp;incredible chocolate smell. I opened the window and took a deep sniff. That familiar scent, coming from a chocolate factory on the west side of town, immediately made me feel at ease. I believe Proust was right when he wrote that smells contain “the vast structure of recollection”.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/20/the-big-idea-looking-for-a-better-life-follow-your-nose\">Continue reading...</a>",

            "subline": "<p>Beecher’s beautiful memoir, written partly in response to the death of her brother aged 25, describes in startling detail the highs and lows of existence</p><p>The title of Anna Beecher’s first work of nonfiction can be read in various ways – an expression of triumph, relief or anticlimax. She uses it as a punchline to the book’s opening chapter, which recounts a car accident she experienced as a graduate student in the US. Here she conjures in vivid detail the violent shock of impact, the moments of silent disbelief in the immediate aftermath as she waits for understanding to catch up with physical sensation, dreading the discovery of what happened to the occupants of the other car, now spinning on its roof.</p><p>In the event, no one is hurt, but Beecher pictures all too readily a parallel reality in which the crash resulted in several deaths, and she and her friend return home carrying the weight of that knowledge. “Our lives are punctured by moments of impossibility when the future unlatches from the present and a gap opens, which we must find a way to step over,” she writes. Her memoir is structured around these points of shock in her own life, and for the most part the experiences she relates are recognisable, even ordinary: being bullied at school, brushes with binge drinking and bulimia, various heartbreaks, a breakdown, a parent’s illness, the loneliness of leaving family and friends to move continents. “Looking back at this chain of non-disasters, from which all parties emerged bruised but alive, I now see loss,” she says. But the cumulative toll of these ruptures is so significant because they are satellites orbiting the central tragedy of her life – the death of her elder brother from cancer at the age of 25: “Little losses, against the vast loss of John.”</p><p><em>We All Come Home Alive</em> by Anna Beecher is published by W&amp;N (£20).

When&nbsp;she was 15, Barbara Walters asked her about her measurements on&nbsp;national TV.</p><p>Shields had hoped that, by her late&nbsp;50s, those days of physical scrutiny would be behind her. Yet now she finds&nbsp;herself fending off judgment about her age. Recently, she was at a&nbsp;party where the male host was crestfallen when she told him the year&nbsp;she was born – 1965 – and said he&nbsp;wished she hadn’t&nbsp;mentioned it. “The&nbsp;fact that I, presumably someone he remembers best as a pin-up from his childhood, could be close to 60 ruined something fundamental for him,” Shields notes. “The implication was that I should keep my ‘vintage’ a&nbsp;secret or be ashamed that I have the audacity to be&nbsp;almost 60, because that meant I could no longer be the dream girl or have sex appeal.”</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jan/15/brooke-shields-is-not-allowed-to-get-old-by-brooke-shields-review-ageing-in-the-spotlight\">Continue reading...</a>",

Yet, after major surgery in 2023, and persistent knee problems that require the use of a wheelchair, he shows no sign of calling it a day. Now, he has decided that an autobiography, originally planned to be published after his death, should come out to coincide with the <a href=\"https://www.cbcew.org.uk/jubilee-2025/\">Jubilee</a> year he has called for the Roman Catholic church in 2025.</p><p>As the first ever memoir by a sitting pope, Hope is a publisher’s dream, with a rich backstory culminating in Francis’s election in 2013. It recounts how, as Jorge Bergoglio, grandchild of Italian immigrants to Argentina, he grew up in a sprawling family, loved football and the tango (which he calls “an emotional, visceral dialogue that comes from afar, from ancient roots”), studied chemistry, then joined the Jesuit order and became a priest. After dallying with Peronism and enduring the Argentinian junta, he became the cardinal archbishop of Buenos Aires. Then, just as he was planning his retirement, Benedict XVI resigned and he was chosen as his successor.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jan/14/hope-by-pope-francis-review-the-first-memoir-by-a-living-pontiff\">Continue reading...</a>",

            "subline": "<p>A bracing contemporary account of the philosopher’s age-old prescription for living</p><p>I<strong> </strong>beseech you,” wrote Oliver Cromwell, in his letter to the general assembly of the Church of Scotland, “in the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken.” Cromwell’s pungent entreaty is often cited in conversations about the importance of self‑enquiry and the perils of overconfidence. It’s an odd but telling choice, given that he was asking others to question their assumptions, while leaving his own unexamined. He had just purged parliament, overseen the execution of Charles I, and was in Scotland leading an army in a pre-emptive strike. Naturally, he wanted the Scottish forces massing for battle to think again. The obvious retort is: “No. You.”</p><p>This is one of several thorny problems philosopher Agnes Callard tackles in Open Socrates, an exploration of Socrates’ “substantive ethics of enquiry”; an approach to knowledge that, she argues, can’t merely be tossed into our usual repertoire of rhetorical flourishes, but rather detonates the bedrock on which we claim to stand: “People will announce, ‘Question everything!’ without noticing they have just uttered not a question, but a command.” The Socratic method is an approach with “colossal ambitions” and not just some antiquated curio we might repurpose to get an edge in business meetings. In fact, its power is so great that we must wield it with great care.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jan/16/open-socrates-by-agnes-callard-review-a-design-for-life\">Continue reading...</a>",

            "subline": "<p>In this fascinating book, the neuroscientist makes a strong case for the therapeutic force of music, describing ways in which it can be a beneficial part of recovery for patients</p><p>That great music can up be uplifting, transportive, transcendent – and conversely sorrowful or deeply unsettling – is a given, but its power to heal in the medicinal sense strikes me as a much more difficult proposition to prove. In <em>Music As Medicine</em>, Daniel Levitin makes a valiant attempt to do just that, citing in his introductory chapter heavyweights such as Confucius – “Music produces a kind of pleasure which human nature cannot do without” – and Plato – “More than anything else, rhythm and harmony&nbsp;find their way into the&nbsp;inmost soul and take hold upon&nbsp;it”.</p><p>While both these statements attest to the deep pleasure to be derived from music – its soothing rather than healing properties – perhaps the most pertinent quote comes from the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/oct/27/letters-by-oliver-sacks-kate-edgar-review\">Oliver Sacks</a>, the neurologist and author of bestselling books such as <em>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat</em> and <em>The Island of the Colourblind</em>. Sacks was an enthusiastic piano player who, according to Levitin tackled Bach fugues “with great joy and exuberance”. He once described his clinical approach as essentially a musical one – “I diagnose by the feeling of discordancy or some peculiarity of harmony.” As Michael Rossato-Bennett’s 2014 documentary <em><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2593392/\">Alive Inside</a></em> shows, the impact of music on people can sometimes be spectacular: one 92-year-old man, Henry Dryer, whose days in a nursing home were&nbsp;passed in a near catatonic state, suddenly became excited when played music from his youth&nbsp;– as Levitin puts it, “singing joyfully and reminiscing”.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jan/14/music-as-medicine-by-daniel-levitin-review-musician-heal-thyself\">Continue reading...</a>",

            "subline": "<p>From run-ins with Hemingway in Havana to gunmen in Guatemala, this colourful collection of the late writer’s long-form journalism shows why Graham Greene was an admirer</p><p>The travelogues of Norman Lewis, which are much admired for the extraordinary burnish they attain, were written by him in a spidery longhand. The author of acclaimed accounts of the Sicilian mafia and the exploitation of Indigenous tribes in South America, he scribbled his rewrites on fresh scraps of paper and, with the help of his wife Lesley, pasted them over earlier drafts until his manuscript crackled like parchment. I observed this process for myself when I interviewed the writer, by then in his 90s. We were at his home, an old rectory in deepest Essex enclosed by a wild garden which grew as high as an elephant’s eye. Here he recuperated between adventures in an “introspective, almost monastic calm”, or so the blurb on his book jackets improbably claimed. Rangy and moustachioed, he had been an early adopter of zoot suits, a crack shot, and a zealous if foolhardy racer of Bugattis. His life had included strenuous ardours and undercover work in Cuba for MI6 and the CIA. Lewis died in 2003. Now many of his best articles are being published between hard covers for the first time in this collection, its title as uncharacteristic of its author as his claims of monk-like meditation.</p><p>By the time I met Lewis, he was enjoying a deserved Indian summer. His backlist had been rediscovered thanks to his indefatigable publisher, Eland, whose red-and-cream livery has become an earnest of good writing. At this stage of his career, it wasn’t only Lewis’s glue-stiffened manuscript that took the form of a palimpsest. He was revisiting his experiences from long ago, overlaying them with the gloss of hindsight. “He started to take the past as his literary object,” according to the writer Julian Evans, who published a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/08/biography\">biography of Lewis</a> five years after his death. One of his greatest books, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/naples-44-9780907871729/\">Naples ’44</a></em>, about his service as an allied intelligence officer among the embattled Neapolitans, took the form of a diary, but Evans found that Lewis kept no journal at the time and made only a handful of notes. The finished text, said Evans, was an “invented diary… scored and coloured by its detached and sensitive remaking”. These revelations threatened to damage Lewis’s reputation. My view, for what it’s worth, is that his later books are like a great artist’s prints, deftly elaborated works run off from plates etched many years earlier.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jan/13/a-quiet-evening-by-norman-lewis-review-they-dont-make-travel-writers-like-this-any-more\">Continue reading...</a>",

Her methods, which include spreading rumours and planting false evidence of adultery, are designed to “change people’s lives for the better, whether they see it that way or not”. Sequestered in European hotels since the death of her husband six years earlier, the start of lockdown finds her a&nbsp;resident of the once-grand Royal Karnak Palace in Luxor, Egypt. It’s clear from the off that her attempts to “liberate” people haven’t always ended well – “I don’t like to talk about the murder” – but Maggie, whose inconsistent account of her past soon has us starting to doubt her reliability, just can’t help herself. When a weedy, bespectacled and sly eight-year-old boy comes to stay at the hotel with his mother, Maggie meets her match. Young Otto realises what she’s up to and starts blackmailing her; carnage ensues as the pair end up locked in a death-spiral. Beautiful writing and expertly torqued tension add up to a delightfully nasty page-turner.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jan/17/the-best-recent-and-thrillers-review-roundup\">Continue reading...</a>",

His books, which draw on his Congolese heritage, tend to be exuberantly imagined, a tad&nbsp;absurd, very funny and focused on&nbsp;off-kilter and off-centre perspectives. In his piquant and spunky new offering, Mabanckou tells the story of Liwa Ekimakingaï, who returns from the dead in search of&nbsp;closure. Told in the second person and engagingly translated by Helen&nbsp;Stevenson, the novel opens in&nbsp;a&nbsp;cemetery in the port&nbsp;city of Pointe-Noire, where the 24-year-old has risen from his grave in&nbsp;a seismic flurry, attired in an orange crepe jacket, a fluorescent-green shirt, purple flares and shiny red shoes. (If you are new to Mabanckou, you might be interested to know that he employs a personal stylist, and that his own sartorial preference tends toward the bold and bright.) Liwa&nbsp;is a classic Mabanckou character:&nbsp;orphaned, irresistibly charming but cruelly bereft of luck.</p><p>Once risen, Liwa falls asleep and begins “the longest dream of his death”, in which images from his four-day funeral mingle with memories of growing up: being raised by his maternal grandmother in the Trois-Cents neighbourhood; getting into mischief with his friends; turning for guidance to the Pentecostal church, officiated by a man later executed for ritual murder; and landing a job as a&nbsp;commis chef in the kitchen of the French-owned Victory Palace Hotel.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jan/18/dealing-with-the-dead-by-alain-mabanckou-review-supernatural-satire\">Continue reading...</a>",

            "subline": "<p>This powerful debut plunges the reader into a raging battle between a young Afghan woman’s cultural identity and desire for freedom </p><p>Nila is the wild, rebellious daughter of Afghan doctors who fled their home before she was born and settled in a brutalist social housing block in Berlin. After 9/11, the family learned to lie (“To resent ourselves with precision”), to&nbsp;hide parts of themselves that seemed&nbsp;too much like “those people”; Muslims in a city where Nazis were alive and well. Then her mother died, and Nila began looking for a way out. Venturing out of her neighbourhood, she saw “people drinking mulled wine at Christmas markets, and between them, everywhere, there was a Mohammed or an Ali or an Aisha trying to get by”. And she hated them, “hated everyone who had the same fate as I did … I was ravaged by the hunger to ruin my life.”</p><p>Poet Aria Aber’s debut novel, Good Girl, follows the grieving Nila as she comes of age in the nightclubs of Berlin. At The Bunker, Nila does ecstasy and falls into an unequal romance with a&nbsp;charismatic American author who dominates and desires her in just the way the damaged creature inside her craves. Marlowe Woods offers her an escape from the Afghan ideal of a “good girl”. He is also a tedious narcissist who pontificates about art, obliviously invites neo-Nazis into his house, and finds foreign cab drivers (some of whom are Nila’s uncles) too depressing to talk to. At the same time, he seems to give himself credit for Nila’s artistic awakening as a&nbsp;photographer: an awakening that is&nbsp;rooted in her otherness, in the yearning both to estrange herself from and depict her parents, to make them beautiful to Europeans. Nila loves literature and art because they make her “a person incomprehensible” to her parents, and yet photography gives her access to her mother’s “secret inner life, adrift in our strange city … an unknowable loss marking her eyes”.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jan/16/good-girl-by-aria-aber-review-coming-of-age-in-berlin\">Continue reading...</a>",

The year is 1920, in a Europe that is still under the pall of the war that should have ended all wars, and Steeds’s stranger is approaching a remote farmhouse in the Provençal village of Saint-Auguste where fabled painter Edouard Tartuffe – Tata, “the Master of Light” – lives with only his niece Ettie for company.</p><p>The newcomer is young Englishman Joseph Adelaide, a disappointed artist and aspiring journalist, in flight from the tragic consequences of a war that has robbed him of his beloved brother and estranged him from his family, after his overbearing father branded him a coward for his conscientious objection. Hoping to begin a new career as a writer on art, Joseph has petitioned Tartuffe for an interview. He asks more in hope than expectation, as Tartuffe is an enigma around whom myths swirl, and has shut himself away from the world for decades. But then the summons comes, and it seems that&nbsp;Joseph may begin his new life.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jan/11/the-artist-by-lucy-steeds-review-mystery-and-romance-in-provence\">Continue reading...</a>",

Becalmed in her deliberately fortress-like London home with her young adult son Paul, she is simultaneously under pressure – teaching primary school children on Zoom, maintaining her stockpile of tinned goods, attempting to communicate with her mother’s care home – and forced into unnatural, unwanted inaction. As a survivor of domestic abuse, and several other threats to her safety and sanity, she is aware of the immense prize – a sanctuary, a job, meaningful relationships – she has secured, but also of its precariousness. Amid these conditions of unbidden contemplation, she begins to write a sort of memoir.</p><p>So too does Buster, the shape-shifting, monstrous undercover cop who once infiltrated the OrKestrA, the “merry little band of very harmless kazoo players” who 20 years previously travelled the country juggling, breathing fire and singing songs to bring hope to the hopeless; Anna herself, as Annanka Ladystrong, was one of their number. But whether Buster’s disjointed, weird document – which he hand-delivers to Anna’s house – is confession or manifesto is unclear. For the reader, these two wildly different accounts of personal and political events begin to resolve into an exploration of identity and purpose – or, in their less convincing passages, as very different civics lessons, at their most successful as a meditation on either adopting or escaping from nihilism.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jan/12/alive-in-the-merciful-country-by-al-kennedy-review-peace-of-mind-meets-a-monster-from-the-past\">Continue reading...</a>",

Confined to bed, I turned to the pile of books that had been staring at me guiltily for weeks, if not months.

It was set in the Germany of the 1930s, following a man on the run from the Nazi authorities, hoping to make his escape by hopping on and off trains crisscrossing the country. As the Gestapo net around him tightens, he plunges into paranoia and breakdown. Perhaps the coronavirus&nbsp;intensified the experience, but I was gripped. I tweeted that it was part Franz Kafka, part John Buchan and completely riveting.</p><p>But there was a twist. This was not a new book, but one written nearly a century earlier. The author was Ulrich Alexander Boschwitz, just 23 years old when his novel was published in 1938 and a Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany. In 1935, he had made his way across Europe to reach Britain, where he was promptly classified as an “enemy alien” and interned in a camp on the Isle of Man. He was held with more than a thousand other émigrés, among them a remarkable number of artists, musicians, writers and intellectuals&nbsp;on what Simon Parkin has called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/13/the-island-of-extraordinary-captives-review-simon-parkin-internment-camp-fleischmann\">the&nbsp;island of extraordinary captives</a>.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/nov/30/how-i-brought-jewish-wartime-refugees-lost-fairytale-back-to-life-king-winters-birthday-jonathan-freedland-ulrich-boschwitz-emily-sutton\">Continue reading...</a>",

Brian Eno and co-author Bette Adriaanse discuss the myth of genius, and how to really unlock your creativity</p><p>Brian Eno’s studio in Notting Hill is tucked away at the end of a cobbled mews, its facade a quarter of the normal size. The effect is like a kind of fairy-door, and as you enter, it opens on to a vast light-filled room with a spiral staircase at the centre. On one side, Eno, in a purple shirt, is hovering silently over a table top making marks on something. On the other, his latest collaborator, the Dutch artist and writer Bette Adriaanse, busies herself with the same task (they’re signing copies of their new book about art). An airy piano melody wafts over the scene: entering it feels like exhaling.</p><p>It does for me, anyway. I’ve been anxious about this interview, not least because of a warning from Eno’s assistant to avoid talking about his musical history, which he doesn’t feel is relevant; she apologises for flagging it up but thought she had “better be safe than sorry”. Eek. A few years ago a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/23/brian-eno-not-interested-in-talking-about-me-reflection\">Guardian interviewer</a> was given short shrift for daring to ask about Eno’s famous collaborations (“I so don’t want to talk about this,” a sleep-deprived Eno snapped).

New York City is 1,000 cities – move five blocks, you’re in a different one – so I had to live there a while to pick up the nuance. Plus, I was in a new relationship and it took about two years to calm down: it’s not just get up, write, sleep, get up, write, sleep, you know. And I needed dough – you can’t live on royalties from a novel – so I was doing TV serials. Also, honestly, I was intimidated: I’m a white writer in a time where people are very sensitive to who gets to write the stories of who. When I wrote <em>Clockers</em>, there wasn’t that policing of language; the whole world became hyperconscious, probably in a good way.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jan/11/richard-price-lazarus-man-novel-the-wire\">Continue reading...</a>",

This, it turns out, is typical. “I usually write until about 4am, then get up around noon,” Brandon Sanderson tells me over video call, leaning forward in a large chair.</p><p>The Nebraska-born author has been writing through the night ever since he was a student some 25 years ago, when he spent his graveyard shifts at a hotel drafting a succession of unpublished novels. In 2005, his debut, Elantris (about religious extremists and a cursed city) was published to acclaim. His hugely successful Mistborn series (metal-fuelled wizards battle an immortal tyrant – then deal with the consequences) began a year later. But the Stormlight Archive, a saga that sits somewhere between Final Fantasy and Ragnarok with a sprinkling of Paradise Lost, is Sanderson’s defining work, accounting for more than 10 million of the 34 million copies he has sold throughout his career.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/dec/06/its-got-everything-you-want-plus-dragons-brandon-sanderson-on-the-joy-of-writing-fantasy\">Continue reading...</a>",

Written and hosted by Nate DiMeo, it eschews the long-winded approach of many audio historians, instead zooming in on small details and stories, from a teenage human cannonball to a small-town alien hoax to the day Niagara Falls stopped falling.</p><p>Now, DiMeo has turned his podcast into a book, which has in turn spawned an audiobook version. This might seem a little superfluous given the project stems from a podcast, but the audiobook has a slightly different flavour, featuring a cast of narrators comprising podcasting and acting royalty. They include Latif Nasser, of Radiolab fame, bringing his customary sense of wonder to A History of Martian Civilisation 1877-1906, about the Italian astronomer who claimed to have discovered human-made canals on Mars; Deadpool’s Ryan Reynolds reading The Nickel Candy Bar, about a publicity stunt involving scores of chocolate bars attached to tiny parachutes being dropped on American towns and cities, causing havoc as they landed; and Dominic Hoffman delivering one of my favourites, The Glowing Orbs, about the 1960s astronaut John Glenn who thought he saw angels in space; in fact, the floating yellow seraphim were small droplets of urine that had been ejected from his space capsule.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jan/17/the-memory-palace-by-nate-dimeo-audiobook-review-bite-size-historical-wonders\">Continue reading...</a>",

Taking place over two days, what the film captures, without overtly talking about it too much, is his father’s experience of dementia, and the gradual dismantling of the intellectual faculties that have been so important to him throughout his life. In a sense the film is about the process of erosion: dementia is not a fixed state condition, but a gradual slippage, and not even a linear slippage at that. Horst has better days and some memories that remain clear, even as other important facets of his life trickle away from him like sand in an hourglass.</p><p>Horst’s house is the main location for the film and functions as a visual metaphor for his condition. He shares it with his wife, and it has lapsed into a state of genteel disrepair, half of a shabby-chic dichotomy where the shabby is gradually encroaching, bit by bit, on the chic. There are whole walls full of beautiful books, the fruits of an academic life, but there are also strips of wallpaper peeling off the wall. Hutter includes plenty of shots of nice tasteful furniture cluttered with badly organised paperwork, an evocation of a life that still has much of the outward shape and structure it always did, but whose internal organisational principles have begun to go awry.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/21/up-the-river-with-acid-review-intimate-abstract-portrait-of-a-fathers-dementia\">Continue reading...</a>",

It’s like the plot was dreamed up by a hack who overheard his six-year-old pitting Lego figurines against one another. You start to expect that any minute Batman or Unikitty will join the fray which – frankly – would be an improvement. What we get instead is tired, cliche-riddled dialogue and bizarre flashbacks in which lead good guy Cassie (Scout Taylor-Compton) remembers how her oceanographer grandpa (Richard Dreyfuss!) encouraged her to face her fears in the water after she witnessed a great white kill her father when she was a kid.</p><p>Now an adult and an expert diver, Cass has returned to the same coastline where daddy got munched, this time with her husband, Gregg (Callum McGowan) who is looking for a shipwreck. Gregg’s old friend Benz (Stuart Townsend) is the captain of the ship they have hired, along with a first mate and some disposable supporting characters who end up as shark bait when feeding time begins. That happens because the ship is overtaken by a bunch of ex-Navy Seals (led by a charisma-free Jon Seda) who press gang Cass, Gregg and the others to dive for some sunken drug parcels.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/21/into-the-deep-review-richard-dreyfuss-brings-the-meaning-to-smugglers-v-sharks-thriller\">Continue reading...</a>",

Viewing a scene through the eyes of an antagonist – such as the <a href=\"http://www.diegesismagazine.com/throughtheeyesofevil.html\">extended opening</a> of John Carpenter’s Halloween – can be a chilling way of drawing viewers into the action, making us feel like we are both the watcher and being watched. When combined with sustained shots without an edit, we become eavesdroppers and voyeurs, lingering long past when the scene should have moved on. From Hitchcock’s Rear Window to Haneke’s Hidden, a camera that holds it gaze can fill us with a creeping sense of dread.</p><p>Presence uses both tricks, telling us a familiar story (a family with baggage move into a haunted house) in an unfamiliar way. Told from the perspective of a ghostly presence, we witness every scene via the point-of-view shot, sweeping between rooms to hear intimate conversations and hovering over characters as they sleep. As the ghost we watch through upstairs windows, peer round closet doors, and recede into corners while scenes unfold.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/21/are-you-being-watched-soderberghs-ghost-voyeur-movie-taps-scientific-truth\">Continue reading...</a>",

Frankly, the best thing about it is the location, a <a href=\"http://elsinghall.com/\">stunning medieval mansion called Elsing Hall</a> in Norfolk with romantic moat, arched doorways, and lush gardens. Fittingly, the house serves as a major engine for the plot, with rumours of ghosts and property values both serving as possible explanations for the dramatic shenanigans.</p><p>In the story, decorative but drippy schoolteacher Cass (Minka Kelly) lives in this beautiful pile with her husband Matthew (Dermot Mulroney, strangely inexpressive) who does something vaguely defined in the energy sector. The couple are Americans who have moved in recently and are doing up the property, but they seem to have settled in comfortably with the local Brits; pretty Cass is also quite a favourite with her male secondary school students. One wet and stormy night, she drives home down the lonely lane of the title and sees a vehicle pulled over, but can’t quite make out who it is inside, apart from the fact that it looks like a woman. Instead of stopping to see if anything is wrong, Cass drives on home. This seed of guilt will blossom quickly into a sense of shame when it’s reported the next day that the woman in the other car was a local friend of Cass who was found murdered.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/21/blackwater-lane-review-haunted-mansion-thriller-ba-paris-the-breakdown\">Continue reading...</a>",

Grafted is actually more superficial than Coralie Fargeat’s film in terms of what it says about appearance – but that is somehow fitting and ably concealed by director Sasha Rainbow with a heavy grouting of punky attitude.</p><p>Chinese student Wei (Joyena Sun) arrives in New Zealand as an overseas student low on self-confidence, partly because of her facial birthmark. Her father, who also had one, died conducting experimental grafting research; his brilliant daughter – wanting to make him proud and herself beautiful – resolves to pick up where he left off. After she settles in at the house of her cousin Angela (Jess Hong), she gets her opportunity when she is cherrypicked by sleazy lecturer Paul (Jared Turner) to help out in his lab.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/21/grafted-review-faceoff-style-skin-graft-horror-has-layers-of-punky-attitude\">Continue reading...</a>",

It asks us to decide if and how the brutalism of the title applies to something other than architecture, and wonders about the future ruin of what we all imagine at the drawing board of youth: an American Ozymandias. It is about antisemitism and the capitalist adventure, about the unassimilated immigrant experience and about American can-do naivety versus the tragic, painful depths of European culture and expertise.</p><p>This is a film with thrilling directness and storytelling force, a movie that fills its widescreen and three-and-a half-hour running time with absolute certainty and ease, as well as glorious amplitude, clarity and even simplicity – and yet also with something darkly mysterious and uncanny to be divined in its handsome shape.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/sep/05/the-brutalist-review-epic-adrien-brody-postwar-architectural-drama-stuns-and-electrifies\">Continue reading...</a>",

Everyone involved has clearly worked extremely hard with what looks like a very low budget, but the cracks do show; it’s impossible to take a gangland crime boss seriously when he’s wearing such a nasty cheap suit. To be fair, most of the funding looks like it’s been chucked at SUVs and imitation assault rifles for the relentless gunfights.</p><p>As it happens, veteran marine Andy (Cullen) carries out his first kills using bits and bobs borrowed from work; he’s the manager of a hardware shop so he picks off the bad guys in a seedy drug den with a staple gun and hammer, hunting down his daughter’s dealer boyfriend Cassius (Daniel Davids).</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/20/sunray-fallen-soldier-review-staple-guns-pressed-into-service-in-brutal-payback-thriller\">Continue reading...</a>",

            "subline": "<p>This tale of nice ordinary folk doing bad things is a cartoonishly grisly comedy with a hint of Fargo, though without the off-kilter humour</p><p>The family that eats together stays together, they say. But the proverb will have to be tweaked for director Caden Douglas’s cartoonishly grisly comedy, in which a family’s regular Sunday dinner ends with the neighbour’s dog running around the back garden with a severed human arm clamped between its teeth. You could describe Mother Father Sister Brother Frank as Fargo-esque, in the sense that it’s a tale of nice ordinary folks doing bad stuff while snow falls serenely around them – though in truth it is less flavoursome and the humour is more obvious, not so deliciously off-kilter.</p><p>It is lunchtime at the Jennings’ house, where mom Joy (Mindy Cohn) is a picture of homely friendliness. Her husband Jerry (Enrico Colantoni) seems a little grumpy while their grown up kids Jolene (Melanie Leishman) and Jim (Iain Stewart) bicker like teenagers, but that seems like fairly standard family dysfunction. Then in walks uncle Frank, a truly loathsome piece of work, sexist and nastily homophobic to Jim, who’s gay.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/20/mother-father-sister-brother-frank-review\">Continue reading...</a>",

Weaving intimate home videos with poignant archival footage, the film-maker makes tangible the invisible link between the private and the public spheres.</p><p>As a family portrait, Nam’s documentary refreshingly moves on from the usual emphasis on generational differences, focusing instead on how youthful idealism metamorphoses over the years. As part of the pro-democracy 386 generation who came of age during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/23/former-south-korean-dictator-chun-doo-hwan-dies-aged-90\">Chun Doo-hwan</a>’s military dictatorship, Nam’s parents were politically active as students. Their paths following their marriage, however, took contrasting turns. Once an optimistic investigative journalist, her father chose to become a civil servant instead, and with each change of government he was arbitrarily shuffled between departments. Nam’s mother, on the other hand, devotes her time to women’s rights groups.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/20/k-family-affairs-review-childhood-memories-south-korea-democracy-nam-arum\">Continue reading...</a>",

Timothée Chalamet’s hilarious and seductive portrayal of Bob Dylan makes him the smirking, scowling and unwilling leader of his generation, whose refusal to submit to the crucifixion of folk-acoustic purity is his own crucifixion. Chalamet gives us a semi-serious ordeal of someone who is part Steinbeck hero, part boyband star, part sacrificial deity. On being derisively asked if he is God, Chalamet’s Dylan replies: “How many more times? <em>Yes</em>.” Chalamet shows us the mysterious burden of celebrity and zeitgeist-ownership endured by a singer-songwriter who transcends John the Baptist (in the form of fatherly and sad-eyed folk mentor Pete Seeger – wonderfully played by Edward Norton) and finally has to wake up his dozing Apostles in Garden of Gethsemane with electric guitars played, in his legendary words, “fuckin’ loud”.</p><p>James Mangold’s biopic, co-scripted by him and Jay Cocks, is based on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/10/dylan-goes-electric-elijah-wald-review-when-bob-took-stratocaster-newport-folk-festival\">Elijah Wald’s 2015 book Dylan Goes Electric! Newport, Seeger, Dylan and the Night That Split the Sixties</a>; it’s the story of Dylan’s musical and personal adventures in the first half of the decade as he electrified the world of folk in every sense. He was carried onwards and upwards by the folk movement appreciative of his poetic talent, but dissatisfied with what he saw as folk’s regressive, museum-oriented placidity (and Dylan is shown here not engaging explicitly with its socialist traditions); he is yearning for the new modern energy of rock’n’roll as the musical form which he has to master if it is not to surpass him.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/10/a-complete-unknown-review-timothee-chalamets-bob-dylan-is-an-electric-revelation\">Continue reading...</a>",

It is a richly compassionate, emotional and detailed drama of family secrets in the wartime Italian countryside, in the manner of Ermanno Olmi or the Taviani brothers. It is wonderfully acted with unaffected naturalism by its cast of professionals and newcomers and plays an extravagant, almost shameless pizzicato on the audience’s heartstrings.</p><p>The setting is the remote Alpine village of Vermiglio in 1944. Cesare is the village schoolteacher whose wife Adele (Roberta Rovelli) is continually pregnant: he is a white-haired, bespectacled man of fierce standards who also runs an adult literacy class and whose prestige in the community equals and exceeds that of the priest. Cesare is played by Tommaso Ragno, looking in Hollywood terms like a cross between Christopher Plummer and Sam Elliott, with innumerable sons and daughters, of whom Dino (Patrick Gardner) is the sulky ne’er-do-well whose mediocrity and drinking pains him.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/sep/11/vermiglio-review-secrets-and-lies-in-idyllic-italian-village-in-the-shadow-of-war\">Continue reading...</a>",

There’s an excellent opening prologue sequence and a very smart final shot – but everything between is silly, misjudged and dull with dud storytelling, middling prosthetics and wide-eyed “I’m scared” reaction acting that will have you checking the time on your phone.</p><p>Christopher Abbott plays Blake, a failed writer and successful dad and househusband, living in New York with adorable daughter Ginger (Matilda Firth) and workaholic journalist-breadwinner Charlotte (Julia Garner). Blake is haunted by childhood memories of being brought up in remote Oregon by his angry and emotionally cold single father (Sam Jaeger). (The film sports half-heartedly with wolfmanness being a metaphor for toxic masculinity and abusive fatherhood.) A flashback reveals how the pair were hunting in the woods one day and menaced by a creature that Blake’s dad gruffly assures his son was a bear. When grownup Blake inherits his dad’s creepy old Andrew Wyeth farmstead, he suggests to Charlotte that they all go on a family trip out there together as a bonding experience. Hugely bad idea.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/15/wolf-man-review-leigh-whannell-julia-garner-christopher-abbott\">Continue reading...</a>",

In the porn-chic era of 1974, Emmanuelle was an odyssey of saucy self-awakening which featured Sylvia Kristel seated on the iconic rattan chair, and was directed by Just Jaeckin, the man with the most outrageous name in adult entertainment. In theory, this meisterwerk is ripe for reinvention as a spectacle of unapologetic sensuality in our new world of the sex-positive and kitsch-positive.</p><p>But even with Noémie Merlant as her lead and no less a film-maker than Rebecca Zlotowski working with Diwan on the screenplay, this Emmanuelle 2.0 comes across as inert and self-conscious, confusing torpor with languor, and endowing the non-sex scenes and also the sex scenes with blankness rather than tension or anticipation or pleasure.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/15/emmanuelle-review-erotic-remake--noemie-merlant-naomi-watts-will-sharpe-audrey-diwan\">Continue reading...</a>",

The star, who had been such a magnetic force in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/29/being-john-malkovich-charlie-kaufman-review\">Being John Malkovich</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/may/02/my-guilty-pleasure-my-best-friends-wedding\">My Best Friend’s Wedding </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/18/something-about-mary-comedy\">There’s Something About Mary</a>, had checked out with a trio of pale production line films that represented what we’d grimly come to expect at that stage of her career. Diaz had once easily moved between dark and light as well as large and small, had smoothed out any of her more interesting edges to become one of the industry’s highest-paid yet most boringly unchallenged stars. That year saw her lost in the juvenile comedies The Other Woman and Sex Tape before being horrendously miscast in a dud remake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/21/annie-review-quvenzhane-wallis-saves-the-day\">Annie</a> and not long after, she chose to retire, perhaps feeling as glum over the quality of her films as those of us stuck watching them.</p><p>News of her re-emergence, after a decade of focusing on family and an organic wine brand, came at an opportune time, as the industry still struggles to find newer and younger yet equally luminous movie stars to take over from those that came before. Many from that era have found success on Netflix, from Adam Sandler and Jennifer Lopez to Jessica Alba, and so it seemed like the smoothest way for Diaz to re-engage with her fans, partnering with her Annie co-star Jamie Foxx for a broadly appealing action comedy. It’s an easy way back in, a low-effort comeback vehicle quite literally called Back in Action, but the film is only a half-victory at best. While it might prove that Diaz still possesses that same particular magic, it also shows that she should be far more discerning with how she chooses to share it.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/16/back-in-action-review-cameron-diaz\">Continue reading...</a>",

Issa Rae’s era-shaping series was about many things – the Black community in south Los Angeles, the diversity pablums of the 2010s, millennial dating, for starters – but at its core, it was a seminal portrait of longstanding, complex female friendship in one’s late 20s, the kind forged by time, ridiculous escapades and plenty of meaty conflict for viewers to hash out at the proverbial water cooler.</p><p>The shadow of the erstwhile HBO series looms large over One of Them Days, a boisterous new buddy comedy executive produced by Rae and penned by the former show writer Syreeta Singleton. Also set in south Los Angeles – albeit on one sweltering, no-good first of the month, when the rent is due and tenancy is in flux – One of Them Days, directed by the Rap Sh!t and music video veteran Lawrence Lamont, similarly concerns two wayward twentysomething besties who can, for enough moments to suffice, conjure the fizzy magic of its forerunner.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/15/one-of-them-days-review-keke-palmer-sza\">Continue reading...</a>",

As Laura Dern’s hexed actor segues into the character she is playing, this digitally shot rampage down Hollywood’s boulevard of broken dreams dials up the narrative fragmentation of his late period. It runs the gamut from inspired camcorder surrealism to making-it-up-as-you-go-along incoherence (which is what it was: Lynch shot without a finished screenplay).</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/17/david-lynch-films-and-tv-shows-ranked\">Continue reading...</a>",

            "subline": "<p>Micro-budget thriller put the brothers on the map, laying the groundwork for a career filled with similarly dark stories of crimes gone wrong</p><p>The loathsome proprietor of a Texas bar slumps in his office chair after hours, seemingly dead from a gunshot wound to the chest. Another man tries to clean up the mess in an effort to cover up a crime that he mistakenly assumes someone close to him has committed. Only the blood isn’t wiped away so easily: it seeps into the hardwood. It streams from the victim’s nose and drips from his forefinger. An old shirt used an improvised mop soaks in much of a puddle, but leaves drippings like house paint on the way to the bathroom sink. Morally speaking, the whole ordeal represents a stain on the man’s conscience. But don’t overlook the plain fact that crime is a messy hassle.</p><p>That’s the defining sequence in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/coenbrothers\">Joel and Ethan Coen</a>’s brilliant first feature, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/06/how-we-made-blood-simple-coen-brothers-barry-sonnenfeld\">Blood Simple</a>, and it may be the defining sequence of a career filled with amateurs who commit crimes of passion or conceive harebrained plots, but wildly underestimate how hard it is. Again and again in Coen brothers crime thrillers, we learn that human beings don’t die so easily and that impulsive acts of violence or ill-considered schemes lead to tragicomic ends. Think of the car salesman who has his own wife kidnapped in Fargo, the vain personal trainers who try to sell secrets to the Russians in Burn After Reading, or the welder who tries to slip away with drug money in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jan/18/drama.thriller\">No Country for Old Men</a>. They either overestimate their resourcefulness or underestimate the potential variables. Whatever the case, they pay for their hubris.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/18/blood-simple-movie-anniversary\">Continue reading...</a>",

Cutaways to the congregation’s reactions – Hugh Grant snickering, Simon Callow stifling a guffaw – do little to convince us that Richard Curtis’s script is top-tier stuff. At least Atkinson brings some typically subtle modulations, such as the vicar’s premature flickers of smugness when he wrongly believes his worst malapropisms to be behind him.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/09/rowan-atkinson-at-70-his-best-films-ranked\">Continue reading...</a>",

Soon, it will have been six years since his low-key zombie comedy The Dead Don’t Die was met with a resounding shrug at Cannes, and it would seem that the coolest cucumber in American independent cinema will respond by paring down to basics. No more fun and games with genre, just a “very subtle”, “very quiet”, “funny”, and “sad” family affair gathering Cate Blanchett, Charlotte Rampling, Adam Driver, Tom Waits and a pink-haired Vicky Krieps around the dinner table. But if it’s going to be anything like his last film dealing with parents and children – the hangdog, allegorical Broken Flowers – then we can still expect the rhyming repetitions, eclectic grab bag of allusions, and other eccentricities typical of the Jarmuschian style. Marrying open-heart emotionality with his wry brand of well-read erudition, he’s putting the “home” in “homage”. <em>Charles Bramesco</em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/07/upcoming-movies\">Continue reading...</a>",

Gibson has directed a number of feature films, (Stallone and Voight also have directing credits); these are vast organisational challenges, requiring energy, vision, skill and political finesse. And that zero-experience lunkhead Pete Hegseth gets to be defence secretary? Despite only knowing how to do sycophantic interviews with the once-and-future C-in-C on Fox News?

It could be the title of any of his films. Lynch saw that if the US dreamed of safety and prosperity and the suburban drive and the picket fence, it also dreamed of the opposite: of escape, danger, adventure, sex and death. And the two collided and opened up chasms and sinkholes in the lost highway to happiness.</p><p>Lynch was a film-maker who found portals to alternative existences and truffled in them like they were erogenous zones, moist orifices of existential possibility. He was the great American surrealist, but his vision was so distinctive that he became something other than that: a great fabulist, a great anti-narrative dissenter, his storylines splitting and swirling in non sequiturs and Escher loops. Lynch was unique, in that he took a tradition of experimentalism in movies such as Maya Deren and Alexander Hammid’s Meshes of the Afternoon and brought it into the commercial mainstream, mixing it with pulp noir, soap opera, camp comedy, erotic thriller and supernatural horror.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/16/david-lynch-the-great-american-surrealist-who-made-experimentalism-mainstream\">Continue reading...</a>",

            "subline": "<p>Despite bold scenes for mainstream American cinema, the sexy dom/sub age-gap film can’t quite figure out what it’s saying about desire</p><p>Arguably the most transgressive scene in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/08/babygirl-review-nicole-kidman\">Babygirl</a>, A24’s erotic drama from the Dutch writer and director Halina Reijn that has Nicole Kidman on the awards circuit, is the first one. The film opens with an orgasm – for both Romy Mathis (Kidman) and her husband, Jacob (Antonio Banderas), together, in the marital bed. But as Jacob slumbers in post-coital bliss, Romy scampers down the hall – the shot of Kidman’s bare, apple-cheeked behind recalls her first scene in Stanley Kubrick’s 1999 film Eyes Wide Shut, one of several erotic 90s touchstones Reijn seeks to invoke and invert through the female gaze. In another room, we witness a private ritual. Her hands desperately flutter across a laptop keyboard; she prostrates herself on the ground, and makes herself come – for real this time – to porn.</p><p>It’s a bold opening salvo for a film, a statement of sorts: this film, arriving amid Hollywood’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/02/hollywood-sex-scenes-decline-by-40-percent\">long slide toward sexlessness</a>, is not about sex so much as <em>female desire</em>. In less than two minutes, we glimpse a tangle of lust, shame, inner chaos, deception, actualization – what Romy sounds like when she’s faking it and when she’s not. For her, as for many women, desire is a maze, bent by societal pressures and warped by internalized incuriosity, non-linear, combustible and not fully comprehensible.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/08/babygirl-movie-review\">Continue reading...</a>",

Of course, the Globes cover TV as well, and may well in years to come find themselves in a new era of relevance as so many, rightly or wrongly, claim the distinction between the two is blurring. It is certainly supposed to be a new era of respectability for the Globes, which (it hopes) has put to bed accusations of non-diversity and kickbacks. It’s hoping also that this year’s presenter Nikki Glaser will do better than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/08/jo-koy-golden-globes-host-2024\">last year’s icily received turn from Jo Koy</a>.</p><p>It’s a great Globes list for streamer Netflix, hip distributor A24 and indeed the Cannes film festival, whose films are well represented. But awards lists will always annoy someone and this year that someone is going to be President-elect Trump, who will no doubt be infuriated at the best actor (drama) nomination for Sebastian Stan, who plays young Trump in the early-years biopic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/20/the-apprentice-review-ali-abbasi-donald-trump-roy-cohn-biopic-jeremy-strong-sebastian-stan\">The Apprentice</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/14/donald-trump-apprentice-film-attacks\">Trump hates it</a>, although I thought the movie went pretty easy on him.

And so it might prove to be with Liza Minnelli. Earlier this year, Minnelli <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/aug/07/liza-minnelli-memoir\">announced that she is writing what is sure to be a blockbuster memoir</a>. The book promises to pull no punches which – when you factor in her parents, her addiction issues and her complicated love life – is a hell of a lot of punches not to pull.</p><p>The book isn’t due to come out until 2026. Despite this, the television rights have already been optioned and, even though it’s so far in the distance, Minnelli has already got several ideas about casting. In an email to People magazine, she wrote: “First, we need a great script and an actress who loves to move,” adding, “Honey, first, I’m a dancer … like the great line in Chorus Line: God, I’m a dancer … a dancer dances … even with replaced hips and scoliosis!”</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/03/a-dancer-dances-even-with-replaced-hips-and-scoliosis-only-one-actor-can-play-liza-minelli\">Continue reading...</a>",

Now 59, perhaps now she can tell us how she ended up so… normal?</p><p>Brooke Shields was at a party, drifting off. The host, a small man with bare feet, was giving her a tour of his wine cellar and she was losing interest, if she’s being honest – which she is now as a matter of principle, after a lifetime of smiling politely and pretending everything’s fine. Her mind was wandering. They say wine gets better with age, she was thinking, “but isn’t there a moment when it turns to jam? And I said to him, ‘I’m 58 and I’m wondering if…’ I didn’t even get the rest of the sentence out before he said, ‘Oh, I wish you hadn’t told me that.’”</p><p>That’s curious, she replied. “I asked him, ‘Did my age make him older?’ I was interested in the psychology of it, that kneejerk reaction.” It was partly, she thinks, her fame – people imprint on a child star, and when they grow up they take it personally. “It felt so indicative of what we do to women, too. And we do the same thing to ourselves – we get caught up, chasing something that’s gone.” It wasn’t the first time somebody had taken offence at the fact she was no longer 15 and she knew it would not be the last, but it was this conversation that inspired her new book about fame, women and the complexity of ageing. She’s called it, <em>Brooke Shields Is Not Allowed To Get Old</em>.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/19/stuff-happens-and-it-sucks-brooke-shields-on-abuse-ageing-and-telling-her-own-story\">Continue reading...</a>",

But the young man who emerged at arrivals that day, having stepped off a flight from Moscow, cut a very different figure. “He looked terrible,” the director recalls. “He was pale. He was stuttering. He was traumatised. It was frankly heartbreaking.

            "subline": "<p>The actor soared to fame in the 90s and 00s in Kill Bill, Charlie’s Angels and Ally McBeal – navigating a notorious time for women on set. Now, she returns to Hollywood in Steven Soderbergh’s Presence – and says she’s still not afraid of standing up for herself</p><p>Boredom is not a feeling with which Lucy Liu is familiar. “Sometimes I wouldn’t mind it,” she says with a smile. “But it feels nonstop. I never get bored because I don’t have time.” If there wasn’t so much to do, she says: “I’m sure I could learn a language, you know, learn how to ride a unicycle. I mean, come on, the list is endless. So it never feels, like ‘What’s left?’ It’s ‘Where do we start?’” Liu is not someone who likes to look backwards. “I think my best work is ahead of me,” says the actor who has done blockbusters (2000’s Charlie’s Angels and its sequel), two Quentin Tarantino movies (Kill Bill Vols 1 &amp; 2), performed on Broadway, shared top billing on a hit TV show (Sherlock Holmes update Elementary, playing a female Watson), all after receiving her big break on another, era-defining series (Ally McBeal).</p><p>Liu’s latest film is Presence, one of Steven Soderbergh’s more experimental works. Although nominally a horror, it’s weirder than that, being shot from the perspective of a ghost who watches a new family move into a house. “He’s truly an artist, because he’s willing to experiment and not really afraid to fail,” says Liu of the director. She has been a fan of Soderbergh’s since his 1989 breakthrough Sex, Lies, and Videotape. “I feel like it [Presence] is coming from a very clear place of curiosity, which I enjoy, because that is artistic freedom, isn’t it? You’re not doing it for ‘the Man’. It’s something you are curious about so then you just try it. It’s almost childlike.” The film has little dialogue, and little backstory. Liu’s character is the mother of two teenagers, and there is clearly tension within the family, not least because she seems to favour her son over her daughter. Sometimes there are scenes, in the ghost’s watchful presence, where nothing appears to happen, which feels a little destabilising to a modern audience used to fast cuts and spoon-fed exposition. “We’re so used to being told what to look at, what to do or feel,” says Liu.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/13/when-i-sense-something-is-not-right-i-am-going-to-protect-myself-lucy-liu-on-success-shame-and-calling-out-bill-murray\">Continue reading...</a>",

Born and raised in the Bronx, he lives in Harlem – the setting for his new novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jan/01/lazarus-man-by-richard-price-review-hard-times-in-harlem\">Lazarus Man</a></em>, in which four strangers cross paths amid the collapse of a tenement block.</p><p><strong>The book’s acknowledg</strong><strong>ments mention its “incredibly long gestation”...</strong><br>\n I signed the contract to write this 17 years ago; if it was a baby, it’d now be applying to college. I’d just written <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jul/04/lush-life-richard-price-review\">Lush Life</a></em>, a sort of panorama of the Lower East Side of Manhattan, and I wanted to try to do the same for Harlem, but I’d only just moved there. New York City is 1,000 cities – move five blocks, you’re in a different one – so I had to live there a while to pick up the nuance. Plus, I was in a new relationship and it took about two years to calm down: it’s not just get up, write, sleep, get up, write, sleep, you know. And I needed dough – you can’t live on royalties from a novel – so I was doing TV serials. Also, honestly, I was intimidated: I’m a white writer in a time where people are very sensitive to who gets to write the stories of who. When I wrote <em>Clockers</em>, there wasn’t that policing of language; the whole world became hyperconscious, probably in a good way.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jan/11/richard-price-lazarus-man-novel-the-wire\">Continue reading...</a>",

            "subline": "<p>James Mangold’s handsome portrait of the enigmatic singer’s stratospheric early career boasts a barnstorming lead performance yet often slips into heavy-handedness</p><p>It’s a remarkable performance. Star of the moment Timothée Chalamet inhabits the loose-limbed, live-wire physicality of the young Bob Dylan and makes an impressively good fist of capturing the frayed hessian of his distinctive voice. Acoustic guitars are plucked and harmonicas honked with the effortless fluency of someone who learned to play almost before they could walk. Chalamet’s Dylan sucks so fervently on his cigarettes it’s as though he’s breathing in the genius of the musical heroes who came before him. But while he radiates insouciant charisma and channels the once-in-a-lifetime talent, he reveals next to nothing about Dylan as a person. This is not necessarily a failure in Chalamet’s acting. It’s a deliberate choice – the film is called <em>A Complete Unknown</em>, after all, and it’s a manifesto as much as a title. But it does mean that this is more a movie about Dylan the phenomenon than Dylan the man; a picture that peers at the folk legend through the distorting lens of fame and fan worship.</p><p>As such, there’s a curious kinship between this handsome if formulaic period piece by music movie veteran James Mangold (he also directed the Johnny Cash portrait <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2006/feb/05/3\">Walk the Line</a></em>) and Michael Gracey’s recent Robbie Williams-as-monkey biopic, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/28/better-man-review-robbie-williams-monkeys-around-in-a-raw-and-emotional-biopic\">Better Man</a></em>. Gracey’s film and <em>A Complete Unknown</em> both explore the impact of sudden and stratospheric celebrity on very young artists. Like Williams, Dylan is shown as a fully formed talent but a half-grown man. But while Williams mainlines fame like a drug and then bares his damaged soul to all, Dylan builds barricades against the encroaching tide of celebrity and protects himself with layers of assumed identities – an idea previously explored by Todd Haynes’s formally daring but frequently infuriating 2007 Dylan film <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2007/dec/23/features.review117\">I’m Not There</a></em>. The sunglasses, the Triumph motorbike, the studied disinterest, the sneer – it’s all, <em>A Complete Unknown</em> suggests, part of the wall that Dylan constructs to protect the vulnerable part of himself, if indeed it exists.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/19/a-complete-unknown-review-timothee-chalamet-radiates-charisma-in-evocative-dylan-biopic\">Continue reading...</a>",

A deeply strange, dreamy voyage into the consciousness of an adult hippo held captive in Pablo Escobar’s infamous private menagerie in Colombia, this fragmented fable from Dominican director Nelson Carlos De Los Santos Arias won the Silver Bear for best director at Berlin last year is now streaming exclusively <a href=\"https://mubi.com/en/gb/films/pepe-2024\">on Mubi</a>. Though it might give the eponymous beast a philosophical, impressively multilingual narrative voice, this isn’t a cuddly, anthropomorphised creature feature: the handsome pachyderm begins and ends the film an elusive mystery.</p><p><em>Pepe</em> is an eccentric addition to a niche subgenre: grownup films centred on animals rather than humans. Outside nature documentaries, animal protagonists tend to be the preserve of animation and children’s fantasies: see the recently Golden Globe-honoured animal-apocalypse adventure <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvz0R_C7Xns\">Flow</a></em>, hitting UK cinemas in March, while almost everyone has some Disney cartoon critter or other that caught their young imagination, be it <em>Dumbo</em> or <em>The Lion King</em> or the intrepid rodents of <em>The Rescuers</em>. (Or even the confusingly humanoid woodland creatures of Disney’s <em>Robin Hood</em>.) Somehow, adults are supposed to grow out of identifying with animals, and yet <em>Pepe</em> channels a more visceral form of that empathy.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/11/streaming-pepe-and-the-best-animal-films-for-grownups\">Continue reading...</a>",

            "subline": "<p>The multiverse has made room for a lot of unlikely reinventions, but murmurs that the late actor’s iconic character may be reworked with a new star could prove controversial</p><p>Marvel’s multiverse has become a narrative Swiss army knife capable of slicing through the thorniest of creative dilemmas and papering over the widest of cracks. That said, few dilemmas are as sensitive as how to move forward with a superhero as iconic as Black Panther. Chadwick Boseman’s portrayal of T’Challa wasn’t just a performance – it was a cultural touchstone, woven so tightly into the fabric of modern blockbuster cinema that imagining anyone else in the role feels like attempting to rewrite history. Four years after Boseman’s untimely death from colon cancer, Marvel faces the delicate task of continuing a legacy that seems impossible to replicate.<br><br>\n If rumblings out of Hollywood this week have foundation, however, the studio is beginning to countenance just that, a new T’Challa from an alternate reality who presumably finds his way into the mainstream Marvel universe via one of the umpteen ways we’ve seen superheroes such as Doctor Strange, various Spider-Men and Scarlet Witch crossing the boundaries between one reality and another. <a href=\"https://www.theinsneider.com/p/marvel-tchalla-recast-chadwick-boseman-death-five-years-new-black-panther\">Jeff Sneider of the InSneider newsletter reports</a> that the studio is finally “firmly open” to bringing back the king of Wakanda, despite previous attempts to recast the role having getting rebuffed by actors who didn’t want to jeopardise their careers by “stepping into Boseman’s gigantic shoes”.</p><p>This might come as something of a surprise to Letitia Wright (T’Challa’s sister Shuri), who took up the mantle of the royal Avenger in the reasonably well-received 2022 sequel Black Panther: Wakanda Forever – though of course, she was not playing T’Challa himself. Wright has previously hinted a third film is in the works, though Marvel has not yet announced it is entering production. “We need a little bit of a break, we need to regroup and [director] Ryan [Coogler] needs to get back into the lab,” <a href=\"https://variety.com/2023/film/news/black-panther-3-letitia-wright-1235484638/\">she told Variety in January 2023</a>. “So it’s going to take a little while, but we’re really excited for you guys to see that.”</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/13/marvel-recast-chadwick-boseman-tchalla-in-black-panther-should-they\">Continue reading...</a>",

I mentioned that, in the age before videos, I had owned and learned by heart the spoken-word-and-song soundtrack for the <em>Magic Roundabout</em> feature film<em> </em><em>Dougal and the Blue Cat</em>.<em> </em>Wright reminded me that, in the 80s, there had been a tie-in <em>Storybook</em> album for Steven Spielberg’s <strong><a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/e-t-the-extra-terrestrial\">ET: The </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/e-t-the-extra-terrestrial\">Extra-Terrestrial</a></strong>, with Michael Jackson narrating the film and breaking down in tears when ET appears to die.

            "subline": "<p>Garner and Christopher Abbott excel in an intriguing thriller that struggles to sustain its shock factor</p><p>The locals call it “hills fever”; the Indigenous community in the isolated Oregon mountain country where Blake (Christopher Abbott) grew up named it “face of the wolf”. The labels vary, but the rumour persists: an infectious disorder that transforms sufferers into unrecognisable monsters with slavering jaws, sprouting thickets of body hair and a taste for human flesh. With that in mind, you may think that returning to the gloomy farmstead he fled as a teen might not be high on Blake’s to-do list. But city life is grinding him down, and he decides that a visit to the country might just shore up his crumbling marriage to Charlotte (Julia Garner) and make some treasured memories with his daughter Ginger (Matilda Firth).</p><p>It’s a promising package. Director Leigh Whannell (<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/29/the-invisible-man-film-review\">The Invisible Man</a></em>) takes genre schlock reassuringly seriously; Abbott and Garner are consistently excellent; the central idea, of the threat that lurks at the heart of the family, is intriguing. But the film soon runs out of bite, with a plot that repeatedly chews over the same thumps, bumps and rattled doors, and the same shadowy menace in underlit basements.</p><p>In UK and Irish cinemas</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/19/wolf-man-review-julia-garner-starring-backwoods-horror-lacks-bite-leigh-whannell-christopher-abbott\">Continue reading...</a>",

The theatre is pin-drop silent as the California singer-songwriter’s astonishing voice, classic and characterful, pours into a heavily reverbed microphone.</p><p>“That was a funny way to say hello,” she grins afterwards. The “pitch” for this one-off show, part of Celtic Connections festival, she tells us, is that it will comprise almost entirely new songs, from a record not yet announced. It’s a bold gambit – usually fans come to hear the songs they know – but Cunningham has a winning confidence in her rich, complex new material, and how it develops her sound. One song, with a restless piano melody that echoes Joni Mitchell, slips organically into a verse from Cunningham’s Grammy-winning folk album Revealer, the lyrics altered to address the wildfires in her home town: “You’re all I’ve ever known, Los Angeles,” she mourns.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jan/19/madison-cunningham-review-pavilion-glasgow-celtic-connections-festival\">Continue reading...</a>",

The first was a gruff sound engineer, David “Ferg” Ferguson, who had been mentored by “Cowboy” Jack Clement, the renowned Sun Records producer who worked with Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis. The second, whom Oldham first saw in Rick Rubin’s studio hallway – “I’ll be unpacking this for the rest of my life” – was Johnny Cash.</p><p>“His physical size and his legacy towered over me at first and then steadily, warmly diminished,” Oldham remembers. Oldham had just turned 30; Cash was 68, ailing, but working hard on his third album of later-life covers, <em>American Recordings III: Solitary Man</em>. It included the title track from Oldham’s 1999 breakthrough album, <em>I See a Darkness</em>, his first under the moniker of Bonnie “Prince” Billy (one he’s been embarrassed about in the past, but loves now, “because the spirit of creation of that entity was that it had to be all about fun”).</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jan/19/bonnie-prince-billy-with-music-we-give-ourselves-up-its-when-were-allowed-to-be-ourselves\">Continue reading...</a>",

His song and album titles are equally poetic evocations of resistance and decay – his new album is called We Will Be Wherever the Fires Are Lit and contains songs such as Meet Me Under the Ruins and Flowers for the Unsung – and the brusque, clanging strums of his acoustic guitar resound with turmoil and determination.

She grew up in west London with her Scottish mother, Malaysian father and brother, and her first group was rap trio the She Rockers. In 1990 she launched her solo career as Betty Boo. With her platinum-selling debut, Boomania, she achieved three Top 10 singles, a Brit award for best British breakthrough act, and international success, before stepping out of the limelight for three decades. During her hiatus, she co-wrote Hear’Say’s Pure and Simple (then the fastest-selling debut single of all time in the UK) and worked with Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Girls Aloud and Blur’s Alex James. She now lives with her film producer husband, Paul Toogood.

One of them, a boxer, was preaching the benefits of fitness training, explaining how he’d improvised an exercise using some equipment he had. Malone noticed the man living in the cell next to him showing a keen interest and asking questions.

Beneath, other, deeper, darker synthesiser tones build and glide. The effect is both faintly ominous and cinematic, perhaps because the sound bears a resemblance to the electronic scores that director John Carpenter devised for his movies in the late 70s and early 80s. It’s a suitably grand and portentous opening for The Bad Fire, an album that coincides with Mogwai’s 30th anniversary.</p><p>If you’re old enough to remember Mogwai as tracksuit-clad teenage upstarts on the fringes of 90s alt-rock – with their gobby interviews and Blur Are Shite T-shirts, their albums named after gang graffiti and their habit of referring to keyboardist Brendan O’Hare, formerly of Teenage Fanclub, as “the relic” – the notion of them as a stalwart band whose albums now regularly make the Top 10, who command <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/14/mogwai-if-the-stars-had-a-sound-review\">documentaries</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/sep/09/mogwais-stuart-braithwaite-on-iggy-pop-it-was-hard-to-believe-the-music-was-made-by-humans\">autobiographies</a>, feels undeniably odd. But an august institution is what they have become – Britain’s best-loved and longest-serving purveyors of what we might as well call post-rock, despite the band’s aversion to the term.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jan/16/mogwai-the-bad-fire-album-review-noise-stalwarts-journey-unexpectedly-heavenly\">Continue reading...</a>",

She’s clearly a fan of dance music’s more experimental potential – opener Damn is an aggressively filtered jungle onslaught, while collaborators include producer Sega Bodega (Caroline Polachek, Shygirl) and electropop cult figure Uffie. But Gray also understands pop, with the campy Angel of Satisfaction stomping around a keening, early Gaga-esque chorus.

The Malian rockers’ 2015 debut, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/15/songhoy-blues-music-in-exile-review\">Music in Exile</a></em>, was a gripping, energising introduction to a talented outfit shaped in the terrifying cauldron of civil war. <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/11/songhoy-blues-resistance-review\">Résistance</a></em> (2017) roamed previously unexplored areas such as funk and Iggy Pop with mixed results, while 2020’s <em>Optimisme </em>was an enjoyably florid, maximalist journey through Songhoy’s “desert blues” roots. <em><a href=\"https://ffm.to/songhoy_blues-heritage\">Héritage</a></em><em> </em>takes a sharp left turn into the band’s first acoustic-led project, and while it lacks some of the incendiary thrills of their very best work, it demonstrates the power and acuity of their songwriting.</p><p>It helps that songs such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jElCeilVldc\">Toukambela</a> aren’t particularly sparse or slow. Close choral harmonies and delicate percussion fill out the nooks normally inhabited by searing guitar solos or thumping rhythms. There’s a soulful frailty in Aliou Touré’s imploring vocal that is incredibly winning, particularly on Boutiki or in duet with Rokia Koné on Norou. As the album sounds more traditionally Malian, the slide guitar during Boroterey feels oddly out of place, yet Batto’s squalling electric solo is perfectly judged. Overall, this is yet another impressive piece of work, full of spark and wonder.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jan/17/songhoy-blues-heritage-review-the-malian-rockers-take-a-gorgeous-acoustic-turn\">Continue reading...</a>",

Across six tracks, Bakorta captures this effervescence, his spirited guitar-playing ringing with trilling harmony on opening track Bonne Année, lilting through a fast-paced refrain on Así Baila El Sintetizador and twitching through syncopated percussive rhythms on La Danza del Pajarito.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jan/17/ale-hop-and-titi-bakorta-mapambazuko-album-review-congolese-soukous-gets-a-maximalist-makeover\">Continue reading...</a>",

There’s a similar willingness to embrace assorted styles on <a href=\"https://ecnmusic.com/gaudi/\">this set of originals</a>, with prog-rock, synth and vocals incorporated into some bold, straight-ahead playing.</p><p>The celebrated Catalan architect of the title is the muse behind just one track – an intricate group arrangement that’s primarily a showcase for Gunter’s spiky guitar. Kirkstall Abbey, a ruined but picturesque Cistercian monastery just outside Leeds, is the source for an almost pastoral piece led by Bland’s piano before mutating into a growling, full band blowout. At 10 minutes, Ruby is the record’s longest number and one of its most intriguing, incorporating a poised vocal by Tara Minton that repeats with two more singers in sync. The other vocal track, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srEtHbe7kw8\">Haflinger</a>, is likewise an elegant Minton outing, beautifully supported by Pusey on bass clarinet, and let down only by a cliche such as “a land… where all your dreams will come true”. Il Ragno Della Tomba (The Spider of the Tomb) provides a downbeat exit, again starring Pusey, an impressive presence throughout. A winning first album.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jan/18/glebe-gaudi-review-a-bold-british-jazz-fusion-debut\">Continue reading...</a>",

There are huge, distorted basslines courtesy of Lily Macieira and equally distorted guitar playing from Phoebe Lunny that flits between post-punk angularity and occasional bursts of poppier, Ramones-y chords. The rhythms are frantically paced, and there are lyrics that focus on societal ills, delivered in Lunny’s distinctive vocal style: she sings like someone angrily trying to make their point in a particularly noisy bar, as a bouncer struggles to usher them out of the door.</p><p>Combined, this music has drawn appreciative nods from a range of forebears including Iggy Pop, Kathleen Hanna and Sleater Kinney’s Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein. Iggy is so enamoured of the duo that he got them to collaborate on a version of Depeche Mode’s Personal Jesus that appeared alongside tracks by Andrea Corr and Rick Astley on a Trevor Horn-helmed covers album: improbable company in which to find a band whose first EP arrived in a sleeve featuring a pile of shit on fire.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jan/09/lambrini-girls-who-let-the-dogs-out-review-stomps-straight-to-the-top-of-british-punks-table\">Continue reading...</a>",

These tracks are all taken from their second album The Infamous, which celebrates its 30th anniversary this year and is still revered for its cinematic darkness, conveying the grittiness of their Queensbridge neighbourhood through evocative and scene-setting lyricism.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jan/17/mobb-deep-review-havoc-big-noyd-02-academy-islington\">Continue reading...</a>",

It’s a cold night. But the frontman’s lack of nudity is pretty much the only key element missing from tonight’s ear-ringing encounter with the reunited US band, touring their late-career album <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/sep/13/the-jesus-lizard-rack-review-chicago-punks-return-with-pyrotechnics-undimmed\">Rack</a></em> (2024). Clad in a black shirt and jeans, Yow prowls the stage, spitting, hollering inchoate insights into the microphone, clamping the cord between his teeth, darkly exhorting the crowd not to stop clapping. He mocks security handing out “little shot glasses of water” – Yow says it in a baby voice – “because someone might be <em>thirsty</em>”.</p><p>Every few songs, Yow launches himself into the audience, crowd-surfing all the way to the mixing desk. Less of a singer than a sui generis declaimer, he smears misanthropic lyrics across the grain of Duane Denison’s axle-grinder guitar and David Wm Sims’s malevolent bass. At the back, drummer Mac McNeilly keeps up a nimble, pile-driving rhythm that somehow manages to swing as well.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jan/11/the-jesus-lizard-manchester-academy-2-rack-review-us-rockers-relive-past-glories-with-added-phlegm\">Continue reading...</a>",

Operating largely outside the traditional framework of the industry, the Vermont four-piece has become <a href=\"https://data.pollstar.com/Chart/2022/07/072522_top.touring.artists_1020.pdf\">one of the world’s highest-grossing touring acts</a> without a single mainstream hit or a platinum-selling album, consistently selling out stadiums and amphitheaters across the United States for decades. Their extraordinary commercial success, built almost entirely on the strength of their live performances and anything-can-happen ethos, stands as a testament to the loyalty and dedication of their fanbase.</p><p>While they have played outside the US sparingly over the years – a couple of tours of Europe and Japan, even <a href=\"https://phish.net/setlists/phish-june-27-1997-worthy-farm-somerset-england.html\">warming up the Pyramid Stage</a> for <em>that</em> Prodigy set at Glastonbury – Phish remain a uniquely American phenomenon.

On Tuesday night, the band returned to their spiritual home ground for the fourth show of a four-night New Year’s Eve run (and 87th date at MSG overall), delivering a marathon performance over three sprawling sets that underscored why they remain the standard-bearers of improvisational rock more than 40 years into their career.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jan/01/phish-review-spiraling-jams-and-communal-bliss-at-madison-square-garden\">Continue reading...</a>",

The reaction is wildly appreciative, if not quite the one that once met this former teenybopper idol at the screaming height of Beatlemania. “That is the biggest wardrobe change of the evening,” he quips. (Swapping his Höfner bass for an electric guitar several times doesn’t count.)</p><p>Welcome, then, to the eras tour – no, not that one, another one; one where costume changes are in inverse proportion to the number of lifetimes and cultural disruptions it spans.

There was clearly something tongue-in-cheek about its title. Overnight Sensational arrived a quarter of a century after the duo he had formed with Dave Prater had finally broken up after decades of acrimony: before the split, Sam &amp; Dave had not actually spoken to each other for 13 years, Moore horrified by a domestic incident in which Prater had shot and wounded his wife.</p><p>That it took so long for one of the most lauded figures in 60s soul to release an album under his own name says something about the difficulties Moore faced in establishing himself as a solo artist. Part of the problem was that Sam &amp; Dave’s career had been on the commercial skids ever since they stopped recording at Stax Records’ Memphis studio and working with the songwriting and production duo of Isaac Hayes and David Porter in 1969: fatally, when Stax’s deal with Atlantic Records had ended, the pair stayed on Atlantic, rather than moving to Stax. Moore was also dogged by heroin and cocaine addiction in the years after the duo’s split, claimed that someone had been spreading a rumour that he was suffering from throat cancer in an attempt to harm his career, and had spent most of the 80s still competing with Sam &amp; Dave, Prater having responded to their break-up by simply recruiting another singer called Sam and carrying on as before.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jan/11/sam-moore-was-more-than-a-soul-man-he-was-one-of-the-20th-centurys-great-live-performers\">Continue reading...</a>",

Her songs can make you doubt what love, happiness and stability are even for. Over the course of six albums, the 31-year-old has become the US’s best young singer-songwriter, stating her feelings with dry amusement or real pain. Her songs are vignettes heavy with painterly symbolism. She connects squalling indie-rock to ambient ballads with plenty in between; her chords never resolve in the way you think they will, rather like life. Perhaps therapists hate her because she is putting them out of a job – as well as being troubling, her music is often uplifting, cathartic and compassionate.</p><p>It turns out she is in therapy herself. “I love therapy! Having someone to talk to, who you don’t feel like you’re burdening, because it’s their job – it really eases up all your friendships,” she says, laughing. “You’re saying it out loud, giving it words; it clears things up. In America, there’s still this notion that you’re not good until you’re happy. I hope we can get away from that.”</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/04/mitski-us-best-young-songwriter-im-a-black-hole-where-people-dump-feelings\">Continue reading...</a>",

It’s personal, non- judgmental – and potentially life-changing</p><p>I am kneeling quite awkwardly on a cushion in a yoga studio in London’s Shoreditch on an unseasonably chilly Wednesday and wondering when exactly will be the optimum time to rearrange my legs. I have an ice-cold mango and passion fruit kombucha beside me and an agonising case of pins and needles. The solution to pins and needles, I learned a few years ago, is to directly confront the agony: pull your legs out from underneath you, bend your toes up as high as they can reach, and yes, it will hurt far more initially, but then the pain subsides. I’d like to do this very much, but sitting opposite me is a man – sitting all around me are men – and it is his turn to talk. He has eight minutes to tell us – all men, all strangers – what has been bothering him lately, or this week, or today, or for his entire lifetime, and right now he is on a roll.</p><p>Here in <a href=\"https://www.menscircle.club/\">Men’s Circle</a>, if you go over your allotted eight minutes, the facilitator of the group is meant to give a polite little “wrap it up now, mate” cough, so everyone can have a fair turn, but nobody wants to do that with this particular man: after a slow, shy start he’s on a tear and words and feelings and secrets I’m not even sure he knew he was going to say are tumbling out, and it feels rude (and possibly destructive) to do anything to stop him. So I’m just going to keep my legs tucked up until he runs out of breath.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jan/19/speak-up-man-how-talking-circles-are-supporting-a-healthier-masculinity\">Continue reading...</a>",

She was in her early 40s, she had a home in the Paris area, a job as a communications manager, a husband who worked for a TV breakfast show and a six-year-old son. She got on well with her parents, who had retired to the picturesque village of Mazan in Provence in the south of France, to a house with pastel-blue shutters where they would all often spend long summers together in the garden under the mulberry tree and splashing in the pool – with barbecues and music, dinner and board games on the patio and country bike rides with her dad.</p><p>Darian remembers the exact moment that this all shattered. It was 8.25pm according to the clock on her kitchen cooker, on a Monday night in November 2020. She had been working from home all day on Zoom calls. She had just put down a bag of Japanese takeaway on the kitchen counter when her mother, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gisele-pelicot-rape-trial\">Gisèle Pelicot</a>, called and told her to sit down in a quiet spot; she had something difficult to say.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jan/11/caroline-darian-daughter-of-gisele-pelicot-interview\">Continue reading...</a>",

Taking place over two days, what the film captures, without overtly talking about it too much, is his father’s experience of dementia, and the gradual dismantling of the intellectual faculties that have been so important to him throughout his life. In a sense the film is about the process of erosion: dementia is not a fixed state condition, but a gradual slippage, and not even a linear slippage at that. Horst has better days and some memories that remain clear, even as other important facets of his life trickle away from him like sand in an hourglass.</p><p>Horst’s house is the main location for the film and functions as a visual metaphor for his condition. He shares it with his wife, and it has lapsed into a state of genteel disrepair, half of a shabby-chic dichotomy where the shabby is gradually encroaching, bit by bit, on the chic. There are whole walls full of beautiful books, the fruits of an academic life, but there are also strips of wallpaper peeling off the wall. Hutter includes plenty of shots of nice tasteful furniture cluttered with badly organised paperwork, an evocation of a life that still has much of the outward shape and structure it always did, but whose internal organisational principles have begun to go awry.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/21/up-the-river-with-acid-review-intimate-abstract-portrait-of-a-fathers-dementia\">Continue reading...</a>",

            "subline": "<p>Reform UK leader, who is in the US for Trump’s inauguration, says early election is ‘not impossible’</p><p><strong>Nigel Farage</strong>, the Reform UK leader, thinks that his chances of becoming PM before Donald Trump leaves the White House in January could be as high as 25%. He made the comment in an interview with Dan Walker for 5 News being broadcast tonight. Farage told Walker he did genuinely believe he could be the next PM. And this is what he said when he was asked if that could happen during Trump’s presidency.</p><p>Look, Labour have got a whopping great big majority. The only thing that really brings an early election is if we get an economic meltdown.</p><p>Now, that is not impossible for two reasons. One, the level of indebtedness is worse than it was in 2008 when we had the big meltdowns. And I think we’ve lived through rocketing stock markets for years. That can’t go on.</p><p>For Reform to replace the Tories three things would need to happen. First they would need to sustain their current momentum well into 2025, then there would need to be a tipping point moment when donors, right-wing media and a number of Tory MPs decided to shift support en masse, and then they would have to win more seats in the 2028/2029 election.</p><p>The first of these seems fairly likely. The enthusiasm of Reform’s voter base, the weakness of the Tory party, and the media need for narrative all point the same way. The biggest barrier is probably Farage’s ability to manage the negative associations caused by Musk (<a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/50340-elon-musks-favourability-remains-unchanged-after-the-riots-but-xs-reputation-continues-to-decline\">who is not at all popular in the UK</a>).</p><p>It may take a long time but if - and it is a big if - Reform remain a major player in British politics, under the voting system we have, it will ultimately lead to the end of the Tory party as we know it.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/20/us-chagos-islands-deal-david-lammy-uk-politics-live-news-updates\">Continue reading...</a>",

Now, with apprehension building as we dive headfirst into the second wave of Covid-19, I reflect on my past seven months as an oncologist. There is no doubt that 2020 has made life for those living with cancer even harder. It’s also become tougher for those of us who work in cancer care.</p><p>We’ve had to adapt our communication skills. For some patients, the shift to phone consultations is a welcome change. For others, a phone call removes the small talk part of consultations, where doctors and patients get to know each other. A physical examination tells us more about our patients than the physical findings alone. The silences we so often employ in face to face conversations, generally intuitively without conscious thought, are awkward on the telephone. Video consultations are better, but do not equate to real life. We would never normally start difficult, life-changing conversations with the words: “Can you hear me?”</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/oct/29/watching-cancer-patients-treatment-alone-heartbreaking\">Continue reading...</a>",

When we got home I had blood tests before being transferred to Southampton general hospital, where it was confirmed I had leukaemia and needed six months of intensive chemotherapy treatment.</p><p>I was a young patient, but I was keen to know everything about my diagnosis and my consultants got used to my constant questioning. One of my favourites was Dr Mary Morgan. Some consultants would ignore me and talk directly to my parents, but she always treated me like an adult. She even agreed to take me to the lab to see my blood being analysed. Although I liked science at school, I wasn’t necessarily good at it. But when it was real-life science happening to me, I found it fascinating.

Just about all of them are centred on older people, the pressures on financially broken local councils from an ageing society and people having to sell their homes to pay for residential care. All these things, of course, are urgent and hugely significant – but they exclude a huge part of society for whom care is just as important. The reason why that happens is not hard to work out: it reflects a set of ingrained, almost Victorian prejudices – and, without wanting to sound too melodramatic, the last frontier of the struggle for human rights.</p><p>Just under <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/insight-and-analysis/data-and-charts/key-facts-figures-adult-social-care\">50% of care spending</a> in England goes on support for disabled adults of working age, and more than two-thirds of that money is dedicated to people with learning disabilities. What this part of the social care picture has in common with help for older people is pretty clear: years of austerity, recruitment problems tied to low-paid jobs (<a href=\"https://www.ageuk.org.uk/our-impact/campaigning/care-in-crisis/brexit/\">made worse by Brexit</a>), and the endless failures of successive governments to tackle a huge list of systemic problems. But the failings of care for disabled people have their own specifics: nonexistent local planning for the transition from childhood to life as an adult, no conception of successful grownup lives that does not involve paid work, and a national habit that is completely toxic: shutting away far too many disabled people, to the point where they simply cannot participate in society.</p><p>John Harris is a Guardian columnist.

Zoom meetings save time and wasteful travel, employers are free to hire talent from anywhere in the country, and employees have escaped escalating property prices in London and steep commuting costs. Working from home (WFH) has been a boon for the climate, too; according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/sep/18/people-who-work-from-home-all-the-time-cut-emissions-by-54-against-those-in-office\">one US study</a>, two to four days of remote working a week lowers carbon emissions by between 11% and 29%.</p><p>Yet WFH is now coming under accelerating attack.

The same age-old sentiment prompted the CBI chair, Rupert Soames, to savage Labour’s flagship anti-gig economy <a href=\"https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3737\">employment rights bill</a> on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme yesterday, warning that the new bill would force businesses to let people go.<strong> </strong></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/14/labour-working-from-home-wfh-culture-war\">Continue reading...</a>",

And once again the Democrats have egg on their faces</p><p>Politics in the US has had its fair share of stupid moments, but the recent banning and (sort of) unbanning of TikTok may rank as one of the stupidest. At the same time, the episode neatly encapsulates the current moment: it’s a perfect example of Donald Trump’s showmanship, the Democrats’ incompetence and the limits of bipartisanship. If I were a TikTok teen I’d come up with some sort of experimental dance to illustrate these themes but I’m old and completely devoid of rhythm, so words are going to have to suffice.</p><p>Let’s start with Trump, who, with his usual talent for self-promotion, has positioned himself as the guy who brought TikTok back from the dead, despite being responsible for signing its death warrant in the first place. To refresh everyone’s memory, in 2020 Trump issued vaguely worded <a href=\"https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-addressing-threat-posed-tiktok/\">executive orders</a> that described TikTok and WeChat as threats to national security. There doesn’t seem to be much evidence, <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2021/03/tiktok-vs-douyin-security-privacy-analysis/\">by the way</a>, that TikTok is any more of a threat to national security than any of the other data-sucking apps we all have on our phones. The main argument from its critics seems to be that it has Chinese owners – and they’re <em>clearly</em> not going to be responsible stewards of people’s data in the way that Americans such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election\">Mark Zuckerberg</a> are.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/21/tiktok-ban-trump-trumptok-us-politics\">Continue reading...</a>",

Letting us indulge our fantasies of treachery</p><p>In the latest episode of The Traitors UK, the final eight players gathered at a candlelit dinner party. After weeks of fraught gameplay, they shared what they would do with the prize money if they were to win. Their teary stories were emotional: donations to disability charities, IVF journeys, putting kids through university and long-overdue honeymoons. The message was clear: these are <em>good</em> people. But suddenly, the game recommenced and we once again wondered: <em>are they?</em></p><p>“To finish that dinner and say goodnight to everyone, knowing one of them might be ‘murdered’ that night …” says Minah Shannon, one of the titular traitors who will be secretly deciding which faithfuls to kill off that night, before breaking out into laughter. “Oh my god, I’m a psychopath!” Alongside her fellow traitors, the 29-year-old call centre manager from Liverpool has betrayed and backstabbed her way through the game. But far from being considered a villain, she has become a fan favourite. This surprising turn is mostly down to the format of The Traitors. For its viewers, the show upends the usual experience of watching a reality TV show – and that’s what makes it so captivating.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jan/21/how-the-traitors-revolutionised-reality-tv-for-the-secretly-evil\">Continue reading...</a>",

Needless to say, it was all a hopelessly overstimulating day for Elon Musk, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/20/trump-elon-musk-salute\">double salute on stage</a> later was a pure <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddWNMSUbcGI\">Dr Strangelove spasm</a>, generously described by the Anti-Defamation league as “an awkward gesture”. Listen, if your friends won’t tell you, then who will?</p><p>As for the staging of the inauguration, which was moved indoors several days earlier, it was an occasion devoid of a sense of occasion. I would honestly have preferred Trump to ride in on the <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/qanon-shaman-celebrate-trump-jan-103839865.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHeoObd-e2xtbVOBeZKoMKA2KeGKgF6_CzC-JpYjNGyWgujlZ9LfsU_ViCTOmzWpzwpixFfCAkHftzGUFIH79MOaBhCMcf7En2FB9MN1cl3aiCUVFL9r4kt35GkDf8KdHRzpT-aq6BY_rkvbIt5KJ1gBiaPuRH9bgNmLfNl_qFuA\">QAnon shaman</a>. Instead, and not to get all British about state events, the world was forced to watch a quite staggeringly inept and lo-fi ceremony. You constantly expected someone to grab the mic and say: “Could the owner of a red Honda Civic please move your car as it’s blocking in the burger van.” Or maybe, as viewers round the globe sat waiting in mortified vain for singer Carrie Underwood’s basic backing track to kick in, to announce: “Apologies, ladies and gents, we have a tech fail. Is there anyone who knows about tech in the house?”</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/21/donald-trump-inauguration-coalition-cronies-creeps\">Continue reading...</a>",

However, the political freedoms and beliefs Koreans have come to take for granted were suddenly shattered on 3 December, when President Yoon Suk Yeol <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/03/south-korean-president-declares-emergency-martial-law\">declared martial law</a>, citing anti-state activities and collaboration with North Korea by some political actors as his reason for doing so.</p><p>His actions utterly shocked the country, and MPs promptly gathered at the national assembly in a clear act of defiance of the ban on political activities that accompanied the imposition of martial law.

President Yoon quickly<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/03/south-koreas-president-lifts-martial-law-in-the-face-of-united-opposition\">repealed the law</a>. Tens of thousands of ordinary citizens filled the streets around the national assembly calling for presidential impeachment. It took two attempts before enough MPs would vote to impeach the president. Watching Yoon appear at his impeachment hearing today, these may appear to be very dark days for democracy.

It is something that comes out of shared history, of childhood misunderstandings and practical jokes.

It would seem bizarre to you to hear me say “tradoos” instead of “trousers”, but it is a legitimate entry in the family glossary. It’s also a way of communicating with my brother, as well as acknowledging and paying tribute to his unique phraseology.</p><p>Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/21/brother-minimally-verbal-language-words\">Continue reading...</a>",

I was there to research a book I was writing about the history of the women’s movement, but also about my mother, whose life story echoes the rise and fall of second-wave feminism. In 1974, a year after Roe v Wade passed, my 22-year-old mother travelled from Essex, England to New York City and took a Greyhound bus across the country to visit June, who was then living in Omaha, Nebraska. At that time, my mum’s life, as it was for so many women of the era, was full of promise. She was the first in the family to go to university, coming of age alongside the revolutionary ideas of the 1960s. I wanted to learn from June who my mum was when everything still seemed possible.

I’d sit at my family computer and Google: “Ways to get pregnant without sex”, “Why am I not having my period?”, “No period after first period”. I’d spend an hour clicking through articles and Reddit threads until I read “no, you’re not pregnant” and “yes, this is normal” enough times. But after days, weeks, or sometimes a glorious month or two, the comfort wore off and doubt would seep back in, until finally I would start my search again.</p><p>Though my period eventually returned, my inability to cope with the inherent uncertainty of the human experience remained, and I kept turning to Google for reassurance. When I was 17, I sat on the sofa doing homework while my parents went out with friends. In the quiet of the house, with nothing to focus on besides a dull textbook and my own internal workings, I noticed my chest felt tight. I had a smartphone by then, which meant I could search Google anytime, anywhere. I looked up “chest pain”, and it quickly became evident I had no choice but to call my parents and go to the hospital<strong> </strong>(after the doctors monitored my heart and took a couple of X-rays, they told me that I probably had acid reflux).</p><p>Elle Warren is a writer covering queerness and mental health</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This was a facade. Mr&nbsp;Trump’s address feigned conciliation but was, in reality, a rightwing call to arms against his enemies, rejecting the unity the ceremony represents. Mr Trump presented a grim picture of a country on its knees that only he can revitalise. He declared not one but two national emergencies, pledging to return “millions of criminal aliens” and “drill, baby, drill” for the “liquid gold under our feet”. His alarming call to “take back” the Panama Canal from China hints at ambitions to reshape the global order, potentially through force.</p><p>A flurry of Trumpian <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/what-is-an-executive-order-trump-ea7ef3c7a785dbd1ee63e0ea3a776e14\">executive orders</a> will accelerate the climate emergency, defy the US constitution over birthright citizenship and reduce the scope of legal protections. Forget the stirring rhetoric of Kennedy; Trump’s message was blunt: enemies at home and abroad, beware.

The alarming yet unavoidable conclusion of a new report from the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) is that “corridor care”, as treatment given in hallways or other unsuitable areas is known, has been normalised to a disturbing degree.</p><p>The accounts of 5,408 nurses came in response to a survey launched before Christmas to counter the lack of official data and national oversight of rising A&amp;E pressures. It reveals the increased medical risks that follow from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jan/16/absolute-pandemonium-stories-of-corridor-care-from-the-nhs-in-england\">patients being treated away from wards</a>, for example due to the lack of access in these spaces to supplies, including oxygen. Nurses also explained the psychological distress caused. Lack of bodily privacy, dignity and having to receive life-changing information in unsuitable conditions were among patient experiences described. Nurses reported trying to look after people in cupboards and even toilets as well as hallways. More than two-thirds said they delivered care in an unsuitable setting on a daily basis.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/19/the-guardian-view-on-corridor-care-the-normalisation-of-crisis-is-shocking\">Continue reading...</a>",

Just about all of them are centred on older people, the pressures on financially broken local councils from an ageing society and people having to sell their homes to pay for residential care. All these things, of course, are urgent and hugely significant – but they exclude a huge part of society for whom care is just as important. The reason why that happens is not hard to work out: it reflects a set of ingrained, almost Victorian prejudices – and, without wanting to sound too melodramatic, the last frontier of the struggle for human rights.</p><p>Just under <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/insight-and-analysis/data-and-charts/key-facts-figures-adult-social-care\">50% of care spending</a> in England goes on support for disabled adults of working age, and more than two-thirds of that money is dedicated to people with learning disabilities. What this part of the social care picture has in common with help for older people is pretty clear: years of austerity, recruitment problems tied to low-paid jobs (<a href=\"https://www.ageuk.org.uk/our-impact/campaigning/care-in-crisis/brexit/\">made worse by Brexit</a>), and the endless failures of successive governments to tackle a huge list of systemic problems. But the failings of care for disabled people have their own specifics: nonexistent local planning for the transition from childhood to life as an adult, no conception of successful grownup lives that does not involve paid work, and a national habit that is completely toxic: shutting away far too many disabled people, to the point where they simply cannot participate in society.</p><p>John Harris is a Guardian columnist.

Other countries have public broadcasters, but none has the BBC’s range and authority. For generations, the corporation has served as a beacon of quality entertainment and journalism. Its World Service is a global shrine to the English language, with an astonishing <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/mediacentre/2024/bbc-global-audience-measure\">320 million</a> worshippers. The BBC’s viewers pay a licence fee of just over £3 a week per household, which covers national TV channels, radio, iPlayer, a variety of apps and the World Service. That seems remarkably good value.</p><p>Yet the problem is obvious. What was designed as the monopoly supplier of British broadcasting is now overwhelmed by a tidal wave of competition. The BBC boasts eight television channels; on my last count Sky had about 50. What with streaming, repeats, catch-ups and podcasts, Britain’s computer-literate younger generation sees nothing special in the BBC: in 2019, YouTube <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/article/bbc-complacent-about-exodus-of-young-viewers-5fnmn3qtz\">overtook the BBC</a> among under-16s. Yes, the BBC delivers Gavin &amp; Stacey, Call the Midwife and Wolf Hall, but so could someone else and simply charge for them. And while documentaries of David Attenborough’s class remain outstanding, BBC One and Two are otherwise desperate for clicks, and seem padded out with hours of low-cost quizshows, antiques sales and celebrity wanderers.</p><p>Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/17/bbc-future-proof-subscription-model-hybrid-funding\">Continue reading...</a>",

The very least we can do is get vaccinated</p><p>Corridors are no place to die, but that is what is happening in British hospitals now as the worst winter crisis in years crams every corner and cupboard in A&amp;Es with very sick patients waiting for beds. Some die on trolleys and chairs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jan/16/hospital-patients-corridors-royal-college-of-nursing-report-nhs\">nurses report</a> to their Royal College. They talk of “straddling a patient doing CPR while everyone watches on”. The <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/north-london-hospital-advertises-for-corridor-nurse-amid-nhs-winter-crisis-13287638\">Whittington hospital</a> in north London and Queen’s hospital in Romford, Essex, have both advertised for “corridor care” nurses. The heath secretary, Wes Streeting, says he will never allow this to become “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/15/pmqs-keir-starmer-kemi-badenoch-labour-conservatives-uk-politics-live?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-6787d27e8f08ce4b9f2dac9a#block-6787d27e8f08ce4b9f2dac9a\">normalised</a>” as it did under the previous government.</p><p>But the president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine suggests it already has, declaring: “This must be a <a href=\"https://rcem.ac.uk/this-must-be-a-watershed-moment-rcem-responds-to-harrowing-rcn-corridor-care-report/\">watershed moment</a>.” Last week, 20 hospitals declared “<a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/how-is-your-local-nhs-coping-under-winter-pressures-13286659\">critical incidents</a>”, because they were unable to cope with the demand for care. For nurses, the crisis means <a href=\"https://www.rcn.org.uk/news-and-events/Press-Releases/patients-dying-corridors-nurses-prevented-delivering-cpr-new-report-reveals\">changing frail, incontinent patients</a> beside vending machines and treating people in storerooms, car parks, offices and toilets, sometimes with just one nurse and one healthcare assistant coping with 20 or 30 patients in spaces blocked with trolleys. Barking, Redbridge and Havering NHS trust has resorted to <a href=\"https://www.pslhub.org/blogs/entry/7896-exclusive-hospital-asks-patients-in-corridors-to-%E2%80%98lobby-mps%E2%80%99-for-funding/\">putting up posters</a> in its corridors asking people to lobby their MPs for £35m to make its A&amp;E capable of coping with double the number of patients it was built for.

Across Westminster, the mere mention of her name summons up a grim past, but she remains ever present: blond bob, eyes that never move and a grin slightly aslant so it expresses not mirth, but faint menace. When least expected, she can bark a laugh that sends shivers up a cabinet minister’s spine. And whenever her shadow looms in SW1, the dread murmur starts: <em>she used to be prime minister, you know.</em></p><p>Liz Truss’s stint at the top of politics ended years ago. Perhaps close confidants and trained medics are yet to break the news, but for her, power is a fading memory, a shrinking image in the rear-view. As the voters of South West Norfolk ensured last July, she is now an ex-politician. Yet in British political culture, she is the great undead. No other prime minister since the Brexit vote so haunts current debates. It’s not just because she never belts up, never stops chuntering about how the Guardian and the BBC <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/13/liz-truss-says-uk-will-fail-unless-british-media-outlets-are-fixed\">must be “fixed”</a>, or <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/liz-truss-sends-cease-and-desist-letter-to-sir-keir-starmer-over-claims-she-crashed-the-economy-13285944\">siccing her lawyers</a> on Keir Starmer.

            "subline": "<p>A blind spot on standards has marked the new government’s early days – but it’s not too late for Labour to restore trust in politics</p><p>In theory, Tulip Siddiq’s resignation as a junior Treasury minister ought to be a political bump in the road for Keir Starmer, not a pothole crash. Siddiq is a moderately interesting politician, but not a major one. She is not a household name. She is therefore expendable. The government’s direction is unaffected by her departure.</p><p>Naturally it is a grim personal moment for Siddiq. But it is mostly a matter of indifference to the British public. This is as it should be. Few ministers ever cut through widely. Even fewer resignations stand out – Geoffrey Howe, Robin Cook and Sajid Javid are among the exceptions, perhaps. Most ministers who resign, though, are simply washed away with the political tide. This is likely to be Siddiq’s fate.</p><p>Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/15/keir-starmer-tulip-siddiq-government-labour-politics\">Continue reading...</a>",

Well, as you probably understand, Russia is no democracy: indeed, this is a nation veering past authoritarianism and into totalitarianism, with more Russians being persecuted for <a href=\"https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2024/02/23/political-persecution-under-putin-highest-since-stalin-era-proekt-a84218\">political activity</a> than since the days of Joseph Stalin.</p><p>Faith in democracy is unquestionably on the decline. A new study finds that a fifth of Britons under 45 believe that the best system for running a country effectively is “a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/12/one-in-five-britons-aged-18-45-prefer-unelected-leaders-to-democracy-poll-finds\">strong leader who doesn’t have to bother with elections</a>” compared with 8% of their older counterparts. That mirrors other findings across the world. A study by Cambridge researchers in 2020 examined attitudes in 160 countries and found that younger generations “have become steadily <a href=\"https://www.bennettinstitute.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Youth_and_Satisfaction_with_Democracy-lite.pdf\">more disillusioned with democracy</a>”. And according to the Pew Research Center, nearly <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/06/18/satisfaction-with-democracy-has-declined-in-recent-years-in-high-income-nations/\">two-thirds</a> of citizens in 12 high-income nations were dissatisfied with democracy in 2024, up from just under half in 2017.</p><p>Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But the persistence of this framework goes deeper than institutional inertia. It reflects a failure to recognise a choice at all – and an inability to imagine and craft better alternatives.</p><p>Treasury orthodoxy is rooted in the Thatcher-Reagan era. It is not just outdated, but has become invisible to those who wield it. Traditional economic training teaches policymakers to see fiscal discipline and market reassurance not just as good options but as the only ones. This narrow view blinds them to evidence that transformative public investment, targeted redistribution and state-led solutions can be essential to tackle inequality, stagnation and the environmental crisis.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jan/20/rachel-reeves-duty-is-to-the-people-not-the-markets\">Continue reading...</a>",

Much of it has considered how democracies might govern AI. Little, however, has been written about the elephant in the room: how labour markets transformed by AI will affect democratic governance itself.<br><br>\n Since the second Industrial Revolution in the late 19th century, the prevailing national political superstructure of industrial capitalism in the global north, apart from the interlude of European fascism, has been various forms of parliamentary democracy. Those structures developed, in large part, because organised labour could bargain with capital for a share of the wealth that human labour creates, and built political parties to represent working people’s interests. Indeed, labour-relations systems, based on freedom of association and collective bargaining, have been pillars of functioning democracies. <br><br>\n However, rather than creating more productive jobs, as some envisage, the AI revolution could entail a transformative reduction in work and employment that would remove capital’s reliance on human labour to produce surplus value and profit. If that leads to the demise of workers’ organisations and to further hollowing-out of the economic base of social democratic political parties, crucial questions arise. How will capital be kept under control and held to account? What will prevent the Musks of the world from achieving complete state capture? What mechanisms will be left to ensure some semblance of redistribution of the wealth created in AI value chains? And how far can incomes fall before levels of demand become unsustainably low? <br><strong>Simon Steyne</strong><br><em>Former senior adviser on fundamental rights at work, International Labour Organization</em></p><p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

She joined the museum&nbsp;in 1945 during the Stalin era, and was appointed director in 1961 by Khrushchev, remaining in the post for an unprecedented 52&nbsp;years.
